The purpose of this program is to provide a quick and easy way to sort through the inhabitants of the Trope Pantheons of TV Tropes -- cleaner than the sprawling Google Docs spreadsheet that was previously in use, and far easier than sifting through the Related pages for a trope to check if the trope is or is not already represented. 

I originally coded and tested this program in PyCharm, but I was advised to share it via GitHub so other people could more easily view it.
