'''Copies, Expies and Other Counterparts'''

The House of Derivatives was created initially to deal with the overwhelmed Character Expies sub-house, before exploding out from the House of Pantheon/{{Characterization}}. It deals with derivative beings, which is not to say that it's a bad thing; "derivative" is simply the most succinct word to include clones, expies, and counterparts of other figures.

The House is a hodgepodge of various elements from both the Characterization and Pantheon/{{Narrative}} houses. It is one of the more visited houses by residents of other houses, since many have ties with the deities in it. In the center of each villa are fountains, each with different statues representing different people [[FountainOfExpies who inspired many other characters]]. There is a factory used for mass reproduction of products for the rest of the pantheon. 

There are two factions leading the House of Derivatives; the Celestial Counterparts and The Exported Sponsors. The former are literally copies of others; the Dark Knights and Spider-Gwen are the parallel universe versions of [[Pantheon/HeroicArchetypes Bruce Wayne]] and [[Pantheon/MannersOfRevival 616 Gwen Stacy]], and Mewtwo is a clone of [[Pantheon/GameCharacters Mew]]. The latter are more inspired by other figures, being copies in a figurative manner.

* Below TheMultiverse rests [[Pantheon/DimensionsAndMultiverses the Dark Multiverse]], a place where whatever can go wrong does. Unstable worlds that were never meant to exist. [[ComicBook/DarkNightsMetal And when Barbatos emerged]] to conquer the light, he had seven versions of [[Franchise/{{Batman}} Bruce Wayne]] answer the call. And of them all, none were as infamous as their leader and Barbatos's [[TheDragon second-in-command]], The Batman Who Laughs; this iteration of Bruce Wayne was driven to the breaking point after The Joker had killed off [[Pantheon/{{Officers}} Commissioner James Gordon]] and the entirety of Batman's RoguesGallery and orphaning children by having them watch The Joker kill their parents in Crime Alley and gassing them with Joker Toxins to convert them into twisted parodies based on himself. Batman finally killed The Joker... with a terrible cost; The Dark Knight was inflicted by a spread of Joker Toxin and gradually over the days, Bruce began to grow more twisted, maniacal, and maddened until he finally snapped and went on a universal killing spree, starting with his own Batfamily. In time, Bruce killed everyone in the universe, including dear friends, family, and associates, converted his own son, Damian Wayne, and several children into Jokerized twisted parodies based on himself, and began to enjoy the thrill of wanton devastation and [[HopeCrusher stripping away hope and expectations]]. He came to the philosophy that his morality kept him bounded and chained from desire and victory and that by having to "adapt" and "laugh away all the restraints" would he claim his prize. He rechristened himself '''The Batman Who Laughs'''.
** It wasn't long before He Who Laughs was met by the dark god, Barbatos, who recruited him into kickstarting an invasion towards the greater multiverse. However, whereas the other six Batmen had their own desires based on loss, grievances, and a twisted way to do go, He Who Laughs had only one thing in mind; [[OmnicidalManiac find and destroy whatever worlds and universes he stumbles across]] alongside demoralizing and breaking the spirits of his victims before killing them. Inevitably, he, Barbatos, and the Dark Knights would arrive in Earth 1, where they would engage in an epic battle against the universe's heroes, especially the Justice League, whom the Bruce Wayne of Earth 1 was a member of. Despite being close to breaking Batman's spirit and dooming the universe, Barbatos and the Knights were ultimately defeated and killed, and He Who Laughs became the only notable survivor of his faction, now captured and imprisoned by the Injustice League. 
** He Who Laughs however managed to escape and continue on with his plans, now becoming a more independent figure who frequently clashed against Batman, his allies, even The Joker himself, which later extended to the members of the Injustice League. It also turned out that the battle waged by Barbatos has the consequences of shattering the Source Wall, which resulted in the release of a malevolent goddess known as Perpetua. He Who Laughs wasted no time in striking an alliance with the "Mother of the Multiverse" in their shared objective of destroying all of reality and banding together with a new batch of Dark Knights as partners, however, He Who Laughs met a premature end, but had a quick backup, namely in the form of having his transference switched to that of a Bruce Wayne who had the powers of [[Pantheon/PowerArchetypes Doctor Manhattan]] in an effort to gain omnipotence and cosmic awareness, sacrificing his fellow Dark Knights except for one, and becoming ''The Darkest Knight'' and making up an extended goal to recreate a "New 52 Planets of Nightmares", which he planned to call "The Last 52". He defected from Perpetua and battled against heroes and villains alike in an effort to seize creation and reality for himself, killing Perpetua once the opportunity for it had arrived. As the war that tore reality and universes apart raged on, Wonder Woman challenged He Who Laughs in one last duel over who got to secure the fate of the Multiverse, culminating with the Princess of Themyscira overpowering The Darkest Knight and sending him off to a dying sun, ending the dark multiversal threat once and for all.
* The Batman Who Laughs ascended into the Pantheon sometime after Barbatos's invasion on Earth 1. However, he came along with the core members of The Dark Knights who represented their position together as it was determined that they were best shown as a team that showcased the dark reflections, worst impulses, and possible corrupted pathways for Bruce Wayne. While initially alright, He Who Laughs grew to detest the concept of sharing his place with the other Dark Knights in the Pantheon and plotted to overthrow them and become the sole occupant, claiming that he was the greatest (and worst) parallel of Bruce Wayne ''and'' The Joker, not to mention that not only did the other Knights die off, but he eventually became more independent and consciously chose his future actions based on what he most desired, Barbatos's death be damned. And eventually, he was successful; He Who Laughs became the sole occupant of his own position, though the other Dark Knights remained as his personal heralds, something that he was aiming for as he wanted to further reinforce his position as their leader and how he has freed himself from the restraints that were is group positioning in the Pantheon. Now, whatever he does in the Pantheon, He Who Laughs will decide, and he alone will execute it, [[OhCrap anyone else be damned]].
** A notable thing about He Who Laughs is his possession of a special sort of material know as Nth Metal, which is Thanagarian in origin and allows for a great host of abilities, namely augmented strength, heightened vitality, negation towards gravity and magic, cosmic awareness, and unorthodox traveling such as through time, summoning, and through dimensions. Though Nth Metal is also one of the only materials that can cause significant harm towards the Dark Knights, He Who Laughs included. While he is wary of those who possess similar weaponry as he does[[note]]on another note, he had to be imprisoned in a call made ''specifically'' out of Nth Metal to keep him from breaking out[[/note]], he similarly doesn't mind a fight either because, in his point of view, he's already got things planned out in advance.
* The Batman Who Laughs is exactly as he is envisioned by others as; a Batman who is twisted to become like The Joker and possessing much of the traits embodied by those two; a genius intellect who is always prepared, a master strategist, and in peak-human physique, yet is mentally warped to a psychotic degree and has an addictive compulsion for killing, crushing the hopes and expectations of others, playing mind-games, and wanton annihilation. However, there is a massive twist; he doesn't desire anything regarding The Dark Knight or The Clown Prince of Crime, but something greater, something grander, and that those two are meant to be mere squabbles at the end of the day. However, Batman and The Joker have repeatedly battled against He Who Laughs and have established a unique enmity that neither of the two has previously gone through. It's bad enough that He Who Laughs desires destruction on a cosmic scale, but to be so bad that two infamous arch-enemies of one another have to ''[[EnemyMine join forces]]'' just to battle against him certainly warrants how dangerous He Who Laughs really is. He became one of the most terrifying and feared beings in the entire Pantheon; even high-profile villains, ''The Joker included'', either want nothing to do with him or simply want him gone from the Pantheon as soon as possible. Not that this actually bothers He Who Laughs one bit, in fact, [[CardCarryingVillain he absolutely revels in his infamy and depravity]] and affirms that he's going to have to keep his reputation that way, as well as coming up with a new array of plans and expectations now that he is a probably a permanent residence of a realm that he has not known of in the past.
* His compulsive addiction towards the concept of meaningless as well as wanting to snuff out any sense of optimism earned him a fan in Junko Enoshima, who was borderline-inspired to learn about the capabilities of He Who Laughs. While he saw Junko as smaller-scaled, he thinks she has potential if she was to increase her scope in spreading despair. She took his critique by heart and has dedicated herself to making her Pantheonic Version of the Killing Game even more terrifying and hopeless than it already was. He Who Laughs has since respected her dedication, and has attended the development of her upcoming project to check up on what can be added that would entice ''him''. That, and he doesn't mind Junko herself falling into despair. [[NightmareFetishist She certainly enjoys the misery herself after all]].
** Makoto Naegi had his suspicions towards Junko held ever since she arrived in the Pantheon, given that he himself was a former participant of the Killing Game and he wants to stop any future attempts for another Killing Game to ever happen. However, despite his own unyielding hope, Makoto was taken aback by how depraved and insane He Who Laughs was and his own partnership with Junko made him even more worried, even more so when he learned how He Who Laughs was willing to destroy worlds to sate his own insane desires. He's since been making sure to further connect and inspire a sense of camaraderie and hope towards his friends, both in his world and his newfound ones in the Pantheon in the hopes that they will unite to oppose and defeat He Who Laughs someday. In contrast, he personally sees Makoto as an annoying brat regarding his optimism and belief in hope, though given what he's learned about him from Junko, he's made preparations on how Makoto and his friends will suffer and die, something which the students are doing their best to avert. 
* Of all the limited amount of allies He Who Laughs could find, none of them appealed to him more than The Plutonian, a being who was formerly the greatest superhero of his world... until one too many criticisms later[[note]]most of which was normally trivial[[/note]], The Plutonian suddenly snapped, abandoned his heroic guise and completely remade himself into a demented, crazed figure who quickly proved himself to be a figurative abomination, who wanted to instill fear and terror on the populace and to validate his position as the most powerful figure in the world, later extending that to the cosmos. He Who Laughs was very quick in commending The Plutonian for choosing to pursue his interests without restraint and for embracing his inner dark side as he himself did. The Plutonian, in response, was eager to respect He Who Laughs for being one of the few to outright compliment the FallenHero for his actions. The two have since formed a strong partnership and have established themselves to be a twisted variation of Batman and Superman. Ever since then, many have been adamant about knowing about what the duo are planning and taking measures to ensure they don't succeed with their goals. That, and making sure that He Who Laughs and The Plutonian don't realize the full extent of their own powers.
* His habits of destroying universes have caught the attention and concern of even deities, such as Beerus and Raiden. Both of them want to keep tabs regarding He Who Laughs and plan to stop him from furthering his actions too much in the Pantheon. Beerus, a God of Destruction himself, worries about what He Who Laughs can do as The Darkest Knight, thinking that him learning about and wanting to be as strong as [[Pantheon/MannersOfAuthority Zeno]] is something that he would likely gun for. Whis himself has prepared for the occasion this happens, acknowledging the seriousness of the threat He Who Laughs represented. Raiden, being a defender of reams, particularly Earthrealm, has wasted no time in condemning He Who Laughs and is more than ready with his allies to fight and oppose him. Liu Kang, having taken up Raiden's responsibilities as a God, is more than up to the task for subduing He Who Laughs, though the latter insists that they are only delaying their own inevitable fates.
* His destructive and nihilistic desires were a common thought he shared with Thanos. However, The Mad Titan himself thinks He Who Laughs [[EvenEvilHasStandards is way too extreme in his objectives and general attitude]]. At the same time, Thanos doesn't want to admit that he may have pettier reasons to be against He Who Laughs, namely that his romantic desires with Death would be lost simply because the kills and destruction He Who Laughs causes would be far more preferable for affection than what The Mad Titan can offer. He Who Laughs couldn't care less about Thanos and his desires, thinking that he is too petty and small-time in his thoughts to really be considered worthy of his attention, a fact that Thanos didn't take very well at all. That fact that his own defeats against [[Pantheon/{{Leadership}} Darkseid]] isn't helping matters either and He Who Laughs is all too willing to milk this information for all it's worth. Though amusingly, he doesn't really care about being romantically sought after by Death, the very reason why Thanos has a grudge against He Who Laughs.
* Zamasu was immediate in declaring He Who Laughs as an ultimate reason why humanity is a scourge that needs to be cleansed from existence, further extending his misanthropic tirade to the Dark Multiverse to further justify his radical opposition towards mortalkind and his contempt towards the corrupted Bruce Wayne. This did attract his attention, but rather than fight against him, He Who Laughs opted for something more humiliating for the Fallen Kai. He approached Zamasu… for a "pep-talk" which was actually about deconstructing the Kai's viewpoints, immature opposition, his psychopathy, [[BecameTheirOwnAntithesis how he was more-or-less a mortal]], and his grand hypocrisy about how mortalkind is a vile scourge upon all life when [[CompleteMonster Zamasu himself is exactly that]]. Zamasu was so broken down by what He Who Laughs had established that he nearly converted into Infinite Zamasu, which the fallen Batman had anticipated, though disappointment followed when Zamasu was subdued by a group of heroes who were alerted to the simple idea that He Who Laughs and Zamasu were to have a talk. Whatever is the case, Zamasu has since held a deep-seated loathing towards He Who Laughs and wants him destroyed the next time they meet. He Who Laughs, on the other hand, is preparing for another BreakingSpeech to prepare for another occasion regarding Infinite Zamasu.
* Seeing as Barbatos was still intact, the Dark God attempted to persuade He Who Laughs to rejoin him and conquer the Pantheon together, but the corrupted Bruce Wayne ended up refusing the offer, stating that ever since Barbatos and the other Dark Knights died, he went solo and he's ended up enjoying being on his own and having full control without a superior instead, leaving Barbatos disappointed. Though the Dark God would soon learn about how He Who Laughs would go on to seize godly power of his own and kill Perpetua, which made him realize that trying to recruit He Who Laughs would be too risky a suggestion at this point. And speaking of Perpetua, she hasn't gotten over her defeat and death and has since dedicated herself to one day kill off He Who Laughs in the Pantheon and reaffirm her position as a credible deity with enough influence and control. That, and she's been getting mocked by He Who Laughs over her loss. 
* The idea of a composite individual based on Batman ''and'' The Joker wasn't exclusive to He Who Laughs, nor was he even the first one. This concept led him to a mass murderer known only as Nemesis, who was delighted to learn about someone who may have been even more deranged than The Joker, and upon learning of the corrupted Dark Knight's feats, Nemesis felt inspired enough to not only expand his killing spree but to also carve out an ideal based on himself and spread it to others, hoping that it could unleash a legion of like-minded mass-killers like himself. He Who Laughs appreciates Nemesis's conviction and urges him to not only act on his most vicious impulses but to enlarge it to the extent where its legacy would be felt by everyone. As if Batman is further shaken by the idea of He Who Laughs and Nemesis having a partnership, those who have personally faced off against them, particularly cops and law enforcement officers and upholders are quickly trying to prepare for what's to come from the two of them.
* Al Simmons has battled several deranged beings, but even he comes to admit that He Who Laughs is easily among those that he can easily call a true demon, whether he is one or not. The corrupted Dark Knight ended up taking this as a compliment and giddily chose to mock Spawn's misfortunes in life as well as mocking him that he will never see his beloved Wanda again, given that The Violator had killed her. Naturally, this infuriated Spawn enough that the two fight against one another every so often. Spawn has also committed himself to make sure He Who Laughs doesn't find a way to become The Darkest Knight again; he's had years of experience battling supposedly omnipotent beings and being reminded by the darkest side of one's character, which Spawn was all too familiar with. On a lighter note, it's helped Spawn and Batman to affirm and make their partnership stronger than it was, even if their preferences and differences clash every so often, but they'll waste no time in devising a way to take on He Who Laughs. 
* Frank Castle, The Punisher, sees He Who Laughs as the main reason why The Joker should have been killed off the moment he marked his presence and uses his existence as a form of criticism towards Batman, who otherwise thinks that he is but another version of himself from the Dark Multiverse that had more success and came closest to achieving his own goals. He Who Laughs thinks Frank is childish, immature, and too small-minded, stating that killing criminals out of retribution for the death of his family is boring, not to mention he uses this as a way to [[NotSoDifferentRemark compare The Punisher to Batman]], something that neither appreciates as [[NotSoSimilar they believe their differences far outweigh their similarities]]. That said, Batman and The Punisher agree on an alliance against He Who Laughs, [[TeethClenchedTeamwork in spite of their tense working relationship]] after He Who Laughs once lured the latter into a trap by mocking his family and his suffering and getting nearly killed for it, were it not for a timely intervention from Batman himself.
** On another note, The Punisher reminded He Who Laughs of The Grim Knight, a version of Bruce Wayne who, instead of being too traumatized to do anything for a while after seeing his parents gunned down in a robbery, decided to immediately seize the opportunity to kill Joe Chill and go on to become a crazed GunNut using his weaponry and resources to instill Gotham City into a personalized police state. Frank was not amused to learn about this information and He Who Laughs taunted him that with the way he's acting, in and out of the Pantheon, he may as well go all out in falling into his darkest desires. It traumatized Frank for a while, though some of his friends and even Batman have opted to help him recover. It's one of the few moments where Frank and Bruce have respected each other, though the former's conviction of killing He Who Laughs hasn't changed. 
* Madoka Kaname had headed about the Dark Multiverse and He Who Laughs, but she wasn't prepared for the occasion that they would meet, which is what happened when the latter quickly learned about The Pantheonic Rebellion, Madoka's position as a HopeBringer, and her sudden depowerment and sought to visit her for "therapy". Madoka was already wary of He Who Laughs and tried to avoid presence, but his own persistence caught up. He began his "therapy session" by calling out her perceived weaknesses and then humiliating her with whatever failures he could have come up with, as well as forcing his nihilistic beliefs into Madoka's psyche, intending to break the girl into a mentally irreparable mess and permanently stunt her desire to help others and be happy. For a moment, it worked, with Madoka so badly shocked that she sobbed in despair seemingly without end, though He Who Laughs sound found himself attacked by Guts, a wandering mercenary and a good friend to Madoka. Annoyed, He Who Laughs attacked Guts in response and landed a cheap shot to the Black Swordsman [[ScrewThisImOuttaHere before fleeing off elsewhere]].
** This event got the Magical Girl Sisterhood to label He Who Laughs as a dire threat that needed to be neutralized as soon as possible. While Madoka managed to recover, He Who Laughs simply proclaimed that he'll do his stint again. He knew that his actions wouldn't have turned Madoka into Kriemhild Gretchen as she wasn't a Magical Girl back then, [[ForTheEvulz he only did it to entertain himself]], but hearing that Madoka having gotten a fraction of her powers back has further caught the fallen Batman's attention. He's already become a huge red alert towards the Puella Magi as they think he has a better chance of turning them into Witches than anyone else could, a fact that He Who Laughs takes utmost pride in and is more than willing to do it. The Puella Magi Magical Girls are afraid of the fallen Dark Knight and prefer to put as much distance as they can, but will fight if it's necessary, and he's going to make sure he does just that to get a better chance of turning the girls into witches. Madoka has since made a vow to stop He Who Laughs with everything she has at the moment, whereas while he gets irritated by Madoka's [[AllLovingHero sweet and loving nature]], he doesn't want a repeat of what happened to him when Wonder Woman defeated him, especially considering that the Princess of Themyscira has similar personality traits as Madoka herself and he wants to ensure Madoka doesn't get to kill him, even if the chances are slim.
** On a similar note, he has found himself opposed by Usagi Tsukino and her Sailor Guardians due to his absolute insanity and [[OmnicidalManiac goals]], and he’s begun preparing for them as he knows future encounters are inevitable. More frightening is his morbid curiosity in what [[Pantheon/MindControl Death Phantom]] [[BrainwashedAndCrazy did to Chibiusa]], and seeks to repeat what he did, but worse. By worse, it means that he seeks to make it irreversible, and the Sailor Guardians were absolutely horrified to learn about these plans. Thankfully, he and Wiseman haven’t come into contact, and they hope it’ll remain that way.
* Whether He Who Laughs can be called a clown is debatable, but it hasn't changed the fact that he keeps a decent relationship with malicious clown-like beings as their desire a similar hobby and goal above all else. He enjoys the company of Kefka Palazzo first and foremost, given that he aimed and succeeded to destroy the world and become a god, something which He Who Laughs also reciprocated in. They also agree in their beliefs that life is meaningless, though He Who Laughs thinks his beliefs have expanded to wanting to enforce suffering and nihilism to the world, a prospect that Kefka similarly found interesting. They've since been working together for a common goal, as well as attempting to regain their ultimate transformations back, seeing as they'll be needing it to further their plans and to destroy their enemies with glee.
** Of course, this hasn't gone unnoticed by The Joker, who has increasingly gotten angry that some of his allies are leaving him to join, whom The Joker thinks is, an imposter. Given how Kefka suddenly left The Joker, he doesn't feel happy that one of his favorite "buddies" in the Pantheon is no longer around, plus he's aware that He Who Laughs may as well backstab and kill Kefka at some point in case he's no longer needed. The Violator equally likes both, but admits that he doesn't want He Who Laughs to take over Hell or the Hall of Pantheon/{{Demons}} for one thing, and Sweet Tooth simply wants to mind his own business and He Who Laughs to get off of his presence or else he'll be gutting him to shreds, a sentiment that he found ridiculously funny. 
** Speaking of Kefka, He Who Laughs found further opposition from a collective of warriors from The World of Balance, who were distressed and disturbed to see just how similar He Who Laughs and Kefka were, let alone the fact that they were in an alliance. [[Pantheon/CommunitiesAndSolitude Terra Branford]] is the most concerned of the lot, which ended up being ironic as He Who Laughs also expressed some interest in her due to Terra's nature of being an Esper. The group has made sure to protect the Pantheon as if it were a second home to them and are ensuring that the Who Laughs doesn't destroy it, though their battles concern on him wanting to capture and sway Terra into his side as a way to spite her friends, desire, and her reputation. All of which Kefka has witnessed with a mix of enjoyment and humor out of the situation that has been bought about by it.
* As a former heroic figure who turned to darkness, one can say that he bears some sort of homage to Anakin Skywalker when he became Darth Vader. However, unlike the Sith Lord, He Who Laughs never repented for his actions and took immeasurable pride out of it. Anakin feels rather disturbed whenever he glances towards the evil Batman; he can certainly see a part of himself, namely what if he didn't regret what he did and remained swayed to the Dark Side until his death. He Who Laughs also understood the reference, although he believes that Vader is missing out in the grand scheme of things after turning back to the Light Side. Anakin only wishes to cut down He Who Laughs, not only seeing him as a pure evil reflection upon himself but of the destructive and corruptive capabilities that he is capable of.
** On the contrary, He Who Laughs finds some kind of appreciation from Emperor Palpatine, seeing as they're fellow practitioners of darkness and are adamant in that they believe nothing is holding them back from. What they desire most. He Who Laughs responds by stating that Palpatine is someone who is worth his time and can potentially align himself with at some point. That, and he personally wants to spread his own psychotic mania and destruction towards [[Pantheon/StarWars those native to Palpatine's realm]] to demonstrate how even those far away from his world aren't immune to the terror that he brings. Palpatine can appreciate that gesture, though even he's being wary of He Who Laughs' capabilities and is preparing for a failsafe in case the corrupted Dark Knight turns against him.
* Finds himself getting along with several omnicidal figures, such as Killbas and another Joker who refers to himself as the Agent of Bad End to distinguish himself from the Clown Prince of Crime. Killbas was intrigued the scope of the Evil Batman's carnage and feels motivated to extend his massacre to all realms and universe's, though He Who Laughs thinks that Killbas should forgo killing himself and instead seek to inspire a legacy of sorts to further the corruption of worlds into twisted parodies based on Killbas himself. He hasn't said much about the matter and states that he is undecided for now. The Bad End Agent is fascinated by his shared trait of spoiling others' trust, beliefs, and hope. He seeks to learn from He Who Laughs about methods to further crush people's hopes, as well as a way to obtain even more than he already does, which the fallen Dark Knight is open to teach him on, so long as it manages to fulfill their own desires and goals.
** That said, not every destructive being is able to be swayed to He Who Laughs' favorability. Evolto, himself a vile being who destroys realms, doesn't take well to the fact that Killbas is aligned with him and struggles to find any alliances against them, no thanks to his own unpopular reception in the Pantheon. Majin Buu has proven to be too simple-minded and He Who Laughs has repeatedly mocked Melkor for not being ambitious enough in his command and goals, mockingly stating that he's only motivated by jealousy and he doesn't bother to fight, instead of letting matters be tended by his Four Horsemen and his GUAE Army. Of course, the GodOfEvil wasn't amused by He Who Laughs' statement and seeks to beat him down to submission to prove his own superiority. His own rivalry against Buu is straightforward, though it's clearly more of enmity if Fat Buu is concerned.
* Many have noted how He Who Laughs [[{{Expy}} bears a very strong resemblance to Judge Death, right down from looks to their attitude, depravity, and goals]]. The two have met repeatedly and respect each others' commitment to their desires, but Death's allegiance to Zamasu, who absolutely detests He Who Laughs, has made the idea of a partnership pretty hard for them. They've instead resorted to playing a game on who gets to kill the most beings in the Pantheon and tally their count with blood, meat, and wreckage. At the very least, He Who Laughs appreciates how Judge Death mocks the justice system and how he sentences others just to fit in with his desires to cause wanton massacres and destruction, while Judge Death sees the corrupted Batman and his feats as a way to up his ante and to further his desire to sentence all life to death. It's an intense rivalry, but neither of them holds much animosity with one another, but rather see it as the most appropriate sporting competition they could come up as far as their insanely twisted minds could conjure up.
* Alongside the Dark Knights, He who Laughs also leads a pack of Jokerized Robins into his services and battles. Given that many of them were children whom he took in and forcibly brainwashed them into rabid beasts, he's become feared by both the Houses of Pantheon/ChildhoodAndAdolescence and Pantheon/FamilyAndRelatives. To make matters worse, one of his plans is to lead a takeover of those houses and convert whatever children he could find there into Jokerized Robins for his use. Given that one of the Robins he Jokerized happens to be his universe's version of Damian Wayne, the [[Pantheon/ChildArchetypes Earth 1 Version]] is incredibly peeved out by this and makes sure to always be with help in case He Who Laughs approaches him. That said, Damian did kill his Jokerized counterpart, though He Who Laughs is willing to replace him with Earth 1 Damian mainly to spite his father. He already has a lieutenant in a younger Dark Multiverse version of himself known as the Robin King at this point, so He Who Laughs doesn't need a replacement.
* His depravity earned the respect of Molag Bal, a Deadric Prince who represented vice and the embodiment of evil [[Pantheon/TheElderScrolls in his home realm]]. He Who Laughs was intrigued to learn about what the King of Rape had to offer and admitted that he saw Coldharbour as an interesting place to visit, though he told Molag Bal to be more proactive in his villainy and provide more "entertainment" in Coldharbour, which the Daedra claimed that he'll be planning something like that in some time. While he has a mixed opinion towards the GUAE due to Melkor, he also admits that he respects Griffith and Johan Liebert as their heinous acts are, in his words, a very well-done joke towards life and everyone in it. Johan is one of the few beings who isn't afraid of He Who Laughs, a trait that actually earned some respect from the corrupted Bruce Wayne and misses the fact that he could be a great ally. Griffith, on the other hand, expresses some confusion towards He Who Laughs due to his maniacal and insane nature and his constant desire for destruction, but he and the Godhand admit to appreciating his determination and the lengths he would go for to achieve his goals. That, and the Godhand see He Who Laughs as a seminal example of one who is willing to sacrifice everything they hold dear to pursue what they desire most. Femto and He Who Laughs later got into an argument over costume design, but they eventually decided to appreciate each other's similar taste in fashion.
* Of course, He Who Laughs would end up meeting with other dark counterparts and doppelgangers of other heroes and he was interested to see just how well did they represent the opposite of their original selves. The corrupted Batman found Vanitas, an entity created by the forced extraction of the darkness of one's heart, namely a young Keyblade wielder named [[Pantheon/NiceAndNasty Ventus]], to be someone whom he liked as Vanitas and he had a knack of causing destruction together and were content with their villainous nature. Vanitas respects He Who Laughs's intellectual planning skills and seeks to learn from this as a means to aid with his future attempts in attacking the Pantheon. He also found some kind of relatability with Lord Drakkon, an evil version of [[Pantheon/HeroicRoles Tommy Oliver]] who was hellbent on causing misery as well as killing off whatever alternate version of himself he stumbled across. The evil Dark Knight and the fallen SixthRanger have agreed on a partnership, if mainly because they secretly desire to be the most notable fiend in the Pantheon and want to bide their time. Of course, the thought of one of the two betraying each other did not go lost on anyone, themselves included, but for now, they've been silent on the matter.
** Strangely enough, to him at least, he didn't appreciate Jeanne D' Arc Alter not only approving of his actions but actively defying him and choosing to value her loyalty towards the [[Pantheon/HardwareAndSoftware Master of Chaldea]] and her feelings towards Jeanne D' Arc above wanting anything to do with the corrupted Bruce Wayne. This did tick off He Who Laughs to an extent, [[EvilCannotComprehendGood struggling to learn why a dark doppelganger would want to still not be bad]], and reacts to this news by intending to attack her master and Jeanne and subject them to breaking their spirits and coldly torturing them out of spite. As a result, both dark counterparts end up clashing against one another frequently, with Jeanne herself coming to oppose He Who Laughs for his unrepentant evil and wanting to continue on with his acts, though she also wants to find a way to absolve and atone the evil Batman, a notion that he mocks and berates Jeanne for, not that she is fazed by it.
** The "Ultimate" Reed Richards sees He Who Laughs as a fascinating specimen and seeks to learn more about him, given that the two have a common connection of them being twisted, evil alternate versions of a renowned hero. However, He Who Laughs found The Maker's extreme pursuit of science to be boring in his point of view and saw that working with him would be a slog for him as "Ultimate" Reed would rather prioritize creating a utopia of "advanced humans", something which the twisted Dark Knight quickly saw as [[NotSoWellIntentionedExtremist "complete nonsense"]] as he also swiftly learned that The Maker was more motivated by a [[AGodAmI God-Complex]] than any true desire to help anyone. Though that said, the two were interested in a special element that each other held possession of; Nth Metal and ISO-8, which was owned by He Who Laughs and Ultimate Reed respectively. In an act of pragmatism, both agreed to share a fraction of their own exclusive elements with one another, seeing as they were curious that the items could potentially enhance their quests, and the two counterparts have often worked with one another at points to further their own agendas.
* He also has a position in the Hall of Pantheon/VillainousCounterparts.

* ''Very'' Conflicting Opinion: [[Pantheon/OtherPowers Matt Murdock/Daredevil]]
* Ascended to the Pantheon after the [[ComicBook/SpiderVerse war against the Inheritors]]. The Court of the Gods enjoyed this version of Gwen Stacy so much that they decided to give her a place her. Spider-Man, the original himself, personally vouched for her.
* When she heard that everyone calls her the "Best Gwen Stacy in the Universe", she was more than curious and went to the House of Pantheon/SpaceAndCosmos to check on the last of her counterparts.
** The first one was her [[ComicBook/TheNightGwenStacyDied Earth-616]] counterpart, the original, where ''the most'' famous event took place and almost every universe copied the events of that location: '''The Bridge''', or what she calls it "the place where many of [her] been [[StuffedIntoTheFridge fridged off a bridge]]". Her initial personality was that of a [[AlphaBitch mean girl]] but thanks to [[CharacterizationMarchesOn her interactions with Peter]] she became the NiceGirl that everybody knows from that point on. Gwen promised this world's Peter that she will not die and that she will watch his back…not just because he vouched for her to come here, but because she had lost her Peter Parker, which wounded her deeply. 
*** Once Gwen discovered the original had been frequently impersonated by clones, the Pantheon decided to stop such an exploitation of her memory by reviving her. Spider-Gwen is now teaching self-defense to her alternate counterpart.
** Next was [[WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan Earth-26496]] where she was a nerd like Peter. Gwen finds this version's ability to stare at someone and make them do what she wants them to do very amusing.
** The one from [[ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan Earth-1610]] she found to be most interesting. That version of her formed a CoolBigSis relationship with the Peter of that world before eventually dating him. Sadly, that version also ended up killed, that time by Carnage... [[spoiler:temporarily. She felt the whole bit of her Earth-1610 self becoming Carnage 2.0 to be out of whack. Even more so with the Peter of that world learning that he was immortal after a climatic fight with the Goblin]].
** Then there was [[Film/TheAmazingSpiderManSeries Earth-120703]], again a nerd, but this time with a relationship so deep that she rivalled 616 Mary Jane's. Her death was not on a bridge, but on a clock tower. What's even sadder is that this Spider-Man almost '''did''' save her. She was saved from the fall, but it was the whiplash from the momentum and the bump on the head that ended her. Still, she was grateful that this Gwen had given a moving speech which inspired him to continue being Spider-Man.
* Gwen found Earth-616 Mary Jane was in the Pantheon. The first thing MJ did when she saw Gwen was hugging her with tears in her eyes. They talked and bonded and Gwen was glad that this Mary Jane is nothing like her counterpart, where she has the [[ItsAllAboutMe me, me and just me attitude]].
* She and Peter can be found practicing in the House of Pantheon/{{Combat}}, where he does not take any chances and makes sure she has all of his skill to protect herself. Likewise, whenever he's going through a tough time and it's obviously affecting his fighting, she never fails to cut the sparring off early and get him talking through the issue.
* Some superheroes wonder why she has a hood as part of her suit. 
* Gwen is also a drummer in a band called "The Mary Janes" which also shows the ego of her world's Mary Jane. Not only is she wicked with the drums, but she can also use those skills to beat bad guys.
* Batman sees parallels with Gwen and Barbara Gordon, in that both are daughters who are heroes with fathers as cops, one as Commissioner and the other as Captain. He took her to the House of Time and Space to show how much George Stacy is like his friend Jim.
* Was worried learning that Matt Murdock was also in the Pantheon, as her world's version of Matt serves as the Kingpin and was also the one who sent a hit out on her father. Spider-Man told her not to worry as the Matt Murdock he's familiar with is nothing like that. Daredevil for his part became rather depressed to find that there exists an alternate reality of himself that would stoop to crime, let alone take the mantle of his arch-enemy.
* Gwenpool, who in a way was inspired by Gwen, idolizes her and envies how her uniform has pants. Gwen is favorable to her, even if she finds weird her view of the multiverse (namely, that it's all a comic from ''her'' dimension).
* Has formed a bond with [[EmotionEater Venom]] to gain revenge against her universe's Rhino for hurting her father, but now she is losing control of herself much to the horror of her friends in the pantheon. Now, she is Gwenom and '''they''' are here to stay!
* [[Creator/HaileeSteinfeld Gwen's voice]] brought her to the attention of Bumblebee. Both have since spent a lot of time together, as Gwen knows a giant robot that even serves as a car is an invaluable ally.

* Mewtwo the Genetic Pokémon is a genetically augmented clone of Mew, itself one of the most powerful Pokémon. Years of horrific gene splicing created an UltimateLifeform...[[GoneHorriblyRight and things quickly went out of control]]. [[WhereIWasBornAndRazed Possibly fatally]]. Mewtwo later set base in Cerulean Cave. It thinks nothing but battling other opponents and proving its supremacy, and while not the monster [[VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue when first introduced]] Mewtwo remains one of the ''best'' Pokémon, keeping pace with legendaries in theory its equals (and in a few places, a bit superior). And through [[SuperMode Mega Evolution]], stat-wise Mega Mewtwo X and Y tie with [[Pantheon/ElementalPairings Mega Rayquaza]] as '''the''' strongest Pokémon except for [[DraconicAbomination Eternamax Eternatus]] (who can't be played anyway).
* Mewtwo's personality in the Trope Pantheon is a [[CompositeCharacter composite]] of his ([[NoBiologicalSex technically genderless]], but identifies as male) [[Anime/PokemonTheFirstMovie first anime adaptation]] and game counterpart. Like in the games [[BloodKnight he thinks little beyond fighting]], but like his anime adaptation he was a creature looking for purpose and who's initial antagonism was feeling used and slighted by the world. The "used" part was from his creators only seeing him as an experiment, and Giovanni (who funded his creation in most canons) seeing him as a tool rather than an equal. He initially planned to KillAllHumans but Ash [[HeelRealization convinced him of the errors of his ways]] and that the circumstances of one's birth is irrelevant. The two remain on good terms. 
** Giovanni status of ArchEnemy has been changing as of late. Mewtwo was shocked to learn that [[VideoGame/PokemonUltraSunAndUltraMoon a version of Giovanni that was unopposed]] wields a Mega Mewtwo X or Y; the fact that Mega Evolution requires a strong bond with that Pokémon [[HiddenDepths proves he can be close to his team]]. Eventually Mewtwo decided [[VideoGame/PokemonMasters he'd try working with him]] out of shared lust for power and hate. Though still enemies, [[WorthyOpponent the two have gained a respect for one another]] [[EnemyMine and will stop fighting each other if it they need to fufill some shared ambition]].
* [[Pantheon/{{Mentalities}} John Hammond]], creator of the Jurassic Bark, was impressed by the personal development Mewtwo went through and proving the potential he has. Mewtwo is mostly ambivalent to this, but he does respect that he treats the dinosaurs he revives with respect rather than as a scientific tool like his own creators did to him. He believes the good doctor would like to study the Red Genesect, [[Anime/PokemonGenesectAndTheLegendAwakened who his more feminine interpretation]] taught respect for the world that the legendary itself had gained. Dr Hammond was intrigued to learn that despite his difficult relationship with humans, Mewtwo might be partially human. [[Manga/PokemonAdventures While explicit in one canon]], it's at most implied in the games. The Genetic Pokémon doesn't care all that much, since as mentioned he finds the circumstances of one's birth irrelevant.
* Mewtwo holds a similar respect to Red, who succeeded at capturing him. Granted he could've just used [[InstantWinCondition a Master Ball]], but to even reach him one has to be Pokémon Champion and deal with very strong wild Pokémon. He holds similar respect for Calem and Serena for reaching a similar level to travel him. By complete contrast, Hunter J is an ArchEnemy given she sees him as a super-valuable black market target. Fortunately Mewtwo has a powerful ally in Sabrina; she's an introvert turned extrovert Psychic trainer (both speciality and her powers) who briefly worked with him in a Pokémon event.
* Some gods have noted that he looks a lot like Giygas before his descent into madness. Mewtwo believes the original Giegue [[ShadowArchetype is a reflection of his past misanthropy]], and the resultant TranshumanAbomination that is Giygas is if he lost full control of his own power. Giygas is not the only deity Mewtwo regards as his EvilCounterpart either: he feels the same towards the I.Rex for being [[GeneticEngineeringIsTheNewNuke genetic titans]] like himself, the former [[GoneHorriblyRight growing out of her creator's control as he did]]. While the I.Rex is too savage to get along with Mewtwo, he feels the tiniest bit of pity for [[FreudianExcuse why she was like that]] as he was once like her. Additionally, he and Cell see each other as rivals given their "genetically engineereed UltimateLifeform" roles. However Mewtwo feels not a nanometer of pity for Cell as he has no TragicMonster elements; he was built as an EnemyToAllLivingThings, [[CardCarryingVillain and embraces the role]]. Plus he mocked Mewtwo by pointing out when [[WebAnimation/OneMinuteMelee he fought his genetic precursor Frieza]] [[spoiler:[[CurbStompBattle he got his ass utterly kicked]] ]]. 
* [[EveryoneHasStandards His contempt for Cell]] seems to further disprove the claims that, [[LackOfEmpathy he has no no concern for others]]. His soft side is best seen in his partnership with Anne-Marie; she reminded him of his first and only human friend, a clone girl called Ai/Amber. He witnessed the sight of a little girl talking to animals, a scene that made the Legendary Pokémon instantly recall back to Amber. Her immense empathy and cheerfulness [[ThePollyanna in spite of her tragedy]] reached his augmented heart, and [[MoralityPet he gave her a hug while saying he would protect her]]. Mewtwo's soft side can be seen with animals who were lab experiments like the cast of [=We3=] or the Plague Dogs. And he considers what happened with the Chimeras to be especially offensive. Surprisingly Mewtwo pities ''[[ToServeMan the Minotaur]]'', as he is a TragicMonster born from unnatural [[BestialityIsDepraved and abominable]] circumstances who's driven to eat flesh out of being such an affront to natural law.
* Because of his past trauma Mewtwo has a stark distrust of the Hall of Scientists and Geniuses, and a starker hatred of the Evilutionists of Mad Science as they[[note]]well not Mesogog but they still don't like each other[[/note]] are scientists who embody everything that led to his trauma and initial hatred for humanity. He's ''especially'' disgusted by Professor Hojo, [[HateSink who doesn't do himself any favors]] by experimenting on [[GuineaPigFamily his own blood]]. [[TheSociopath Naturally, Hojo simply sees Mewtwo as a powerful resource and lab creation]]. While not nearly as repulsive, Dr Frankenstein's past actions and abandonment of his creation bring up Mewtwo's own issues and he hates him too. He also has an ax to grind against Maxwell Lord, who wants to use his psychic powers and his own mind control to get rid of metahumans. [[spoiler:[[Film/PokemonDetectivePikachu Someone tried to pull a similar stunt in the past]].]]
* He once held the trope GoneHorriblyRight. Or as one of his creators said [[WhereIWasBornAndRazed before he burned with the rest of the lab]], "we dreamed of creating the world's most powerful Pokémon...[[LastWords and we succeeded]]". Currently the holder of the trope is Bass, who doesn't wish to kill his creator, [[WellDoneSonGuy but the desire to impress]] means he intervenes with any other attempt to take out Mega Man. Mewtwo regards Bass as immature, but he's also well-aware his initial rebellion [[PsychopathicManchild had a fair amount of immaturity as well]]. Though Bass didn't regard him as a robot to surpass at first, as another being born artificially as a might fighter the Genetic Pokémon sees him as an opponent to prove his strength. [[ArrogantKungFuGuy And Bass admits]] he'd ''love'' to prove which of humanity's creations is superior-one of metal, or one of flesh.
* Mewtwo's greatest Pokémon rival is Arceus, the Alpha Pokémon. Arceus was the first to exceed him in raw stats, and handed him a definitive defeat. However [[VideoGame/PokemonXAndY Mega Evolution]] allowed Mewtwo to surpass even Arceus, though it was '''not''' easy to win a second time. Even then Arceus has told him that [[WorthyOpponent while they enjoyed their fight]], [[VideoGame/PokemonLegendsArceus the Arceus he knows]] [[FightingAShadow is a piece and not the whole]]. The genetic experiment has sworn to surpass even that, and is perfectly cognizant of the whole "man/science versus God" subtext that exists in their rivalry. His former greatest rival was Mew, the very being his DNA derived from. They stopped their rivalry after seeing how pointless the clone vs original battle was, but remain aloof to one another.
* He has a less intense rivalry with Silvally. Because of their similar backgrounds of scientific creations that..didn't go according to their creators plan they relate to one another. But both were made to be fighters, and Silvally seeks to challenge Mewtwo to prove it is no mere {{Expy}} of the older legendary. [[BloodKnight Mewtwo welcomed this]]. The Martian Manhunter is another rival and friend, having started [[DefeatMeansFriendship by fighting him over the legendary causing a ruckus]] [[NoodleIncident for reasons lost to time]]. Mewtwo finds his introspective and calm personality combined with his ability to live among humanity interesting. He was a bit surprised someone as powerful as him [[WeakToFire was so vulnerable to fire]], though as Mewtwo himself has a weakness to bugs perhaps he shouldn't really talk.
* Other than challenging others or accepting challenges to combat, Mewtwo prefers a secluded existence and spends most of its time within its shrine. He has accepted many challengers, [[WebAnimation/DeathBattle perhaps the most notable being Shadow]]. The two are well-aware of [[UltimateLifeform their similar backstories]], to the point some speculate Mewtwo started the fight by accusing him of "copyright infringement". [[spoiler:[[MindRape Through his psychic powers]] he swiftly beat Shadow [[ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice by impaling him]] [[VideoGame/PokemonAdventures with a spoon]].]] Afterwards Mewtwo mused to himself that he should try to master the Chaos Emeralds' powers to become "Super Mewtwo". The hedgehog robot Metal Sonic and the ever smug Infinite decided after this they want to do what Shadow failed and defeat the legendary Pokémon. Mewtwo [[BringIt welcomed Metal to try]], and simply said nothing to Infinite because he's considers him "[[InferioritySuperiorityComplex pathe]][[PsychopathicManchild tic]]".
* He likes Vegeta. [[ChallengeSeeker They have a fair bit]] [[BloodKnight in]] [[SmugSuper common]], if in a RedOniBlueOni outlook, [[WebAnimation/DeathBattle and they bonded over]] [[spoiler:owning Shadow and hatred of Frieza]]. Mewtwo is interested in Goku as a potential sparring partner, however he's a bit more interested in Shigeo Kageyama due to his psychic powers. Mewtwo has shown more interest in Carrie White due to her psychic and anger brought out by trauma, something he's more familiar with, leading to him wanting to aid her in fine-tuning and increasing her powers. Another friend of his he's gained Meruem, and by extension Komugi. Mewtwo used to have similar goals to Meruem and they share the "engineered UltimateLifeform" traits.
* As one of those who took part in Master Hand's competitions, Mewtwo is often called on by other "Smashers" to join the fray. His arrival is often met with much fanfare by followers. Unfortunately, Mewtwo has been having trouble getting reinvited. The ''Brawl'' iteration had him not only have a single trophy in his name but also replaced by Lucario (who has also come back for the 4th tournament). Then, an announcement trailer that had someone ''similar'' to Mewtwo revealed that a newcomer named Greninja has also come in. Since both of these Pokémon ascended into the Pantheon, Mewtwo has trained hard to beat them to the ground for taking his spot. However, it was revealed that he was coming back for the fourth Smash Tournament (albeit, as a latecomer, but better than never). His return was met with a bigger fanfare by his followers. As of now, he is currently training to achieve his revenge against the two usurpers.
* Some see him as his world's answer to FrankensteinsMonster. It's not something he denies, as they are intelligent beings who turned against their creator and to put it lightly had reason to distrust people. The two like to philosophize together. Along with disliking the Monster's creator, the Genetic Pokémon can't ever get himself to trust Dr Fraken Stein, [[MadScientist and he's not exactly wrong to do so]]. He doesn't trust the SCP Foundation either, as while many of the anomalies they contain are better contained someone like him doesn't like their attitude of ''everything'' anomalous needing to be kept under wraps[[note]][[EveryoneHasStandards though with ethics of the practice considered]][[/note]] for some [[TheMasquerade masquerade]]. They're leaving Mewtwo alone for now, but don't think he gives a good case for himself by being friendly with The Magician. Mewtwo has defended this friendship by stating he's interested [[TurnedAgainstTheirMasters in a kindred spirit]] [[BloodKnight who desires to defeat anyone]] and not something nefarious.
* Mewtwo has found himself relating with Laura Kinney and Solid Snake, fellow clones like himself that he's personally impressed with and can understand the trauma. He's generally on good terms with Spiderman's clones and Lea too, though not as much. However just because someone's a close doesn't mean Mewtwo likes them; he cannot imagine why the Grineer consider themselves some supreme species due to their severe CloneDegeneration [[Radio/PokemonTheBirthOfMewtwo while he holds an immortal lifeforce]]. It's one he gets from Mew, who imagines the Grineer are greedily looking at their genetic code for their own villainous goals. Mewtwo straight up dislikes Rau Le Creuset, [[OmnicidalManiac due to his misanthropic goals]] as revenge for his doomed nature as a clone. Before anyone calls him a hypocrite, [[TheAtoner it's BECAUSE he used to be similar as to why he's offended]]. On a lighter note Mewtwo is annoyed by the imperfect duplicate Bizarro due to how...weird and backwards a copy of [[Pantheon/{{Heroism}} Superman]] he is. [[BadIsGoodAndGoodIsBad Bizarro believes this is a compliment]].
* Fecto Forge finds itself relating to Mewtwo as a powerful, psychic being pushing the AnimalisticAbomination line and [[LackOfEmpathy having no compassion to others]] (though that's more true with [[TheSociopath Fecto]]). It was amused by Mewtwo having his own "Elfilin" in Mew and tried to bond with Mewtwo over how they both broke out of a lab. Mewtwo refuses to bond with Fecto though, [[IWorkAlone due to being asocial]] [[EveryoneHasStandards and seeing Fecto too violent and destructive]]. 
* Another person who finds himself relating to Mewtwo is [[Pantheon/KillersAndAssassins Agent 47]], being that they were both created as genetic experiments whose creators sees them as a tool for their own end. The stoic bald hitman can also relate to his struggles in finding a purpose upon discovering their clone origins. While 47 does show ''hints'' of compassion compared to someone like Fecto, Mewtwo still can't find himself bonding with him either given [[Main/ProfessionalKiller his profession]] and that Mewtwo tries to distance himself from such violence. Nevertheless, they would come to a mutual understanding with each other as they go their separate ways. 
* Was recently embarrassed at how he was captured by a [[WebVideo/TwitchPlaysPokemonBlack2 girl named CLY]] on the first turn at full health. '''With a Timer Ball'''. [=LOLRanger=] laughed for days on end at the [[http://www.reddit.com/r/twitchplayspokemon/comments/2bgx4l/mewtwo_vs_cly/ initial encounter.]] Later, he became major target of interest for The Mob as they have tried several times to capture Mewtwo only to fail. He takes great amusement in [[IShallTauntYou taunting them]] every time they fail to capture him.

* [[CaptainErsatz No, that little guy up there is not Mickey Mouse.]] Back in the thirties, Warner Bros. launched their new ''Looney Tunes'' franchise, starting with a little guy named Bosko, the Ink-Talk Kid, who proved to be relatively popular. However, at that point, Their rival Disney was dominating the market with a certain cartoon character named Mickey Mouse. Warner Bros, who at that point were desperate, then made a character that would surely win an audience. How? By simply ripping them off. The result was Foxy, an ''incredibly'' blatant copy of Mickey, complete with the role of TheEveryMan and his lack of a distinguishable personality (Well, okay, he was a little more aggressive, but that was about it). He only lasted 3 shorts before Disney themselves asked his creators to stop using them, thus ending his career. And after making a guest appearance in ''Tiny Toons'', he disappeared from animation.
* The Court Of The Gods were in a pickle. You see, they were trying to find a candidate for the trope CaptainErsatz, but the sheer broadness of the trope made it a lot trickier than one would assume. It wasn't until a bored member was browsing the internet when he came across cartoons starring Foxy, which they initially thought were just Mickey cartoons with the mouse drawn weird. It wasn't until Bugs Bunny himself came in and explained his deal, which made The Court realize that they may've found their candidate. A short bit after, a small fox found himself in a strange place, where he was greeted by a humanoid rabbit munching on a carrot, who explained where he was and why he was here. Happy that he was just being acknowledged, the fox gleefully accepted his role, and ran off to his new temple.
* While he ''is'' still an {{Expy}} of Mickey Mouse, he does have the advantage of not aging past the thirties, meaning that he's permanently in the "Rubber Hose" style of animation, with his movement and environment being [[DerangedAnimation full of wacky and weird imagery]]. This helps him stand out more from his more successful counterpart, though even then it just brings up comparisons to Mickey in his prime. He also embraces MickeyMousing, with his movement, dialogue, and even ''background'' matching whatever song is playing in the background. As it stands, these make him quite the character.
** Naturally, being TheEveryman, he constantly changes his job and role, having been in his cartoons alone a cowboy visiting a bar, a trolley man driving, well, a trolley (Though that was AllJustADream), and a traffic cop thwarting criminals. With how huge The Pantheon is, he now has an even ''bigger'' range of jobs, some of which will be mentioned here in a second.
* Despite his origins, he's still relatively accepted by most of the Looney Tunes cast, seeing how he ''was'' one of the first of their kind. Besides, if they ever need a prank involving a certain mouse, Foxy could easily stand in for him. This mostly just occurs with the nicer toons, though, as Sam and Marvin just regard him as a pest, Daffy seeing him as inferior to him, and Elmer just seeing him as another animal to hunt, what with Foxy being a fox and all.
* As for Mickey Mouse himself, he just feels sorry for the guy. Sure, he was trying to ride on his coattails, but Warner Bros was struggling to find an identity at the time, and the guy himself was far from malicious about it, having long accepted Mickey as the superior toon. He's currently thinking of giving him lessons on how to act more differently from him.
** On a similar note, Betty Boop has also expressed her sympathy, as she was once merely a side character to her old boyfriend, Bimbo the dog, who was dropped because of the ValuesDissonance of a human dating a dog settling in at the time. The whole human dating aside, which he found a bit weird, Foxy still pities the poor dog, as at least Foxy went out via lawsuit.
** Lastly, he's gained the sympathy of Felix the Cat, who found Foxy's lack of modern relevance to hit close to home, though obviously the fox has it worse. Foxy isn't really comfortable outright befriending the above three, seeing how they're from wildly different and more successful cartoons, he's still happy about the recognition the three are giving him.
** On the other side of the spectrum, he's outright made friends with Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, who finds the fox to be pretty relatable. The ironic fact that Mickey was an Expy of ''Oswald'' is not lost on either of them. He's even offered the fox to crash at his house after Foxy's temple [[RuleOfFunny exploded for basically no reason]]. Well, by "house", he meant his garage, but hey, it's the thought that counts.
* Recently meet the easygoing Huckleberry Hound while the two were working as traffic cops. [[NoodleIncident Long story short, it resulted in the biggest traffic pileup in The Pantheon's history]]. Still, that didn't stop the two from becoming friends, spending their time hanging out at a bar, spending their time listening to Huck's many, ''many'' jobs. And yes, Oh My Darling Clementine was playing in both instances, complete with MickeyMousing.
* To absolutely nobodies surprise, he made quick enemies with Judge Doom. Humorously, it actually took Doom a while to realize Foxy was even in The Pantheon in the first place, thanks to the latter's obscurity. Foxy, being an old cartoon character, was utterly ''baffled'' at how a movie would get away with [[VileVillainSaccharineShow such a vile villain in an otherwise lighthearted movie]].
* Once had a run-in with the notorious Reynard the Fox, having heard of the guy and how he was famous for his deeds. Naturally, he was curious on what he actually did to earn the reputation. An hour later, he ran out of Reynard's temple, screaming about how freaking ''depraved'' the fox was. [[ComicallyMissingThePoint I mean, what sane person pees on children?]] Doesn't help that he accidentally broke Reynard's couch, which didn't do favors for his relationship with him.
* One of the jobs the little fox took was one at Freddy Fazbears Pizzeria, notorious for its killer animatronics. Believe it or not, it was actually more of a difficult night for the robots themselves, as Foxy's naturally cartoon abilities made tracking him down a lot more difficult than it should've been. Chica eventually managed to preform a sneak attack on the fox, and he was found the next morning stuffed in a suit, albeit still alive [[RuleOfFunny because it was funny]]. He's maintained a dislike of the animatronics ever since, a sentiment that the gang shared. The most notable part? [[{{Irony}} Foxy the Pirate Fox was the only animatronic not active that faithful night.]]
* One notable encounter was when he had the job of protecting a farm from any thieves, and during it, he had an encounter with one Mr. Fox. Initially prepared to call the authorities, Mr. Fox's story of having a family to feed, as well as being, well, a fox, managed to win him over to his side, allowing him to steal what he needed to survive. It got him a scolding from the farm owner, but it didn't bother Foxy too much. Did we mention that the aforementioned farmer was [[AssholeVictim Mr. Bunce]]?

* The Seven are a group created by Vought-American to serve as the world's biggest superhero team. They were the children of unknown poor women, people "the world wouldn't have missed", and were injected with huge doses of Compound V as fetuses. At birth, they each caused the deaths of their mothers with their superhuman powers and were raised by V-A scientists until they were ready to be presented to the world as the most powerful heroes on the planet.
** In terms of marketing, public appearances and talk shows, the Seven were unbeatable, but the rare times V-A tried to make them do actual heroic deeds, it ended in disaster. On September 11th, 2001, the Seven tried to stop a diverted plane that a group of terrorists wanted to send against the World Trade Center, but their inexperience and lack of training led to a catastrophe. The end result was the death of one of their teammates and the plane crashing on the crowded Brooklyn Bridge.
** From that day onwards, the Seven found themselves constantly tailed by the Boys, a black-ops group of super-powered agents who wanted to bring them to justice. One of them in particular, Billy Butcher, had a personal reason to go against Homelander. Then, after a clash between the two teams led to the deaths of the innocent nieces of Mallory on one side and of Lamplighter on the other, the groups reached a truce to prevent mutually assured destruction.
** Years later, the Seven once again came into conflict with the Boys. When the Boys blackmailed the Seven, Jack From Jupiter [[spoiler:lashed out by killing Terror, Billy Butcher's dog. Butcher subsequently retaliated by killing Jack. Shortly afterwards, Homelander enacted his plans to launch a superhuman coup which involved most of the world's superheroes staging a bloody takeover of the White House and Pentagon. During this time, the Deep chose to leave whereas A-Train was kidnapped by Butcher and ultimately killed Hughie in revenge for killing his girlfriend Robin and having tried to rape Starlight, the newest member of the Seven who had also started dating Hughie. When Queen Maeve and Starlight similarly tried to leave, they encountered Homelander and Maeve died fighting against him, allowing Starlight to escape. Later on, Homelander was confronted by Butcher in the White House, where it was revealed that Black Noir was a clone of Homelander and had deliberately framed him into becoming evil in order to carry out his purpose. After Black Noir managed to kill Homelander, he was mortally wounded by the Marines outside the White House and finally killed by Butcher]].
* The ascension of the Seven into the Pantheon was a somewhat notable event, as their temple, which looked like their satellite headquarters, suddenly appeared in the sky one day. Initially confused, the Seven were far from happy to see each other again. While Homelander and Black Noir started fighting, the rest of the team ran away from them as fast as they could to the ground below. Having recognized their headquarters, the Boys were among the first to arrive on the scene. Starlight had a happy reunion with Hughie, but it was suddenly interrupted by A-Train, who immediately attacked Hughie in revenge for him [[spoiler:having previously killed A-Train]]. Fortunately, Barry Allen and Wally West arrived shortly after and quickly managed to restrain and subdue A-Train.
* After Black Noir left and everyone managed to calm down, a brief standoff occurred between the Seven and the Justice League, who had been informed about the Seven by the Boys. Surprisingly, Homelander proposed a peaceful resolution, remarking that his past villainy was the result of [[spoiler:Black Noir tricking him]] and that he didn't intend to misbehave within the pantheon. Although they didn't quite trust him, both the Justice League and the Boys accepted his offer of peace, although they warned him and his teammates that they would be keeping an eye on them.
* Sometime later, reports came in of Homelander seemingly going on a rampage throughout the Pantheon, committing various violent acts with the intent to establish his dominance over others. After making sure that it wasn't Black Noir dressed as Homelander, it was initially suspected that Homelander had developed a SplitPersonality. However, it was discovered that the other members of the Seven ([[AdaptedOut except]] Jack From Jupiter) had similarly [[Series/TheBoys2019 undergone a change in personality]]. After a while, they all changed back to their regular selves and were dismayed to learn that no one had any idea how to prevent it from happening periodically.
* Although the group generally dislikes each other and rarely works together, they've occasionally teamed up when confronted by credible threats. Lex Luthor has occasionally targeted them, viewing them (though mostly Homelander and Black Noir) as potential threats and unworthy perversions of his actual enemies. The "Hero Killer" Stain has similarly targeted them for being fake heroes, although he's admitted that at least Starlight might be worth sparing.
* Both Homelander and Black Noir have occasionally clashed with Regime Superman and Plutonian. While Black Noir is typically dismissed by Regime Superman as a maniac and is on amicable terms with Plutonian, their opinions of Homelander are a bit more mixed. High Councilor Kal-El has offered him the chance to redeem himself by joining forces, while Plutonian encourages him to embrace his crimes and return to being full-blown evil.
* Exclusive to Homelander:
** According to V-A's official story, Homelander was an alien, born on a distant, dying world. Still an infant, he was put in a space rocket and sent away from his home planet just before it exploded, and he reached Earth after a perilous voyage. Finally, he landed in the United States of America and was found by an elderly couple, who adopted him, named him John, and raised him while teaching him the highest and purest American values, such as patriotism, altruism, respect for truth and justice. As he grew up and his incredible alien powers manifested, John chose to protect and serve the planet that had given him a new home, and he became the Homelander, the most powerful and righteous superhero the world had ever known.
** In reality, Homelander was the result of one of V-A's bio-engineering experiments, in which they had collected some genetic material from the captive Nazi superhuman, Stormfront, and injected it along with extreme amounts of Compound V into a fetus, the son of a mentally challenged woman. The baby grew much faster than normal, and in a matter of weeks, he burst out of his mother's womb, killing her. He was immediately taken in by V-A's scientists and grew up in a controlled environment, where people tested him and registered any new powers he manifested. Meanwhile, V-A's workers also instructed him on the character he would have to be for the public as soon as he was an adult, and thus created the myth of the Homelander, the greatest hero in history, a legend dressed in the American flag.
** In public, The Homelander acts simply perfect, a hero who incarnates all the values and principles so missed in a consumerist society, and who reassures the American audience by dressing in the national symbols. In private, however, the leader of the Seven is a megalomaniac who indulges in any form of violence, from sexual extortion to unnecessary murder, just because he's able to. As powerful as he is, though, he still depends on Vought-American's money, as they fund his luxurious lifestyle, so he has to control himself, at least to a certain extent.
** Due to his less than stellar reputation, few people are willing to openly associate with him. Homelander managed to bond with the comparably [[CaptainPatriotic America-themed]] Comedian and Destroyman, the former similarly being an amoral NominalHero and the latter being a SmugSnake who [[FauxAffablyEvil pretends to be nice and honorable]]. Homelander also gets along with Gaston and Zapp Brannigan, both of whom are similarly vain and narcissistic.
** His interactions with Superman and [[SupermanSubstitute those like him]] tend to be rather awkward. In his regular personality, Homelander expresses regret for his past actions and tends to stay out of trouble. However, his alternate personality is not only a [[TheSociopath full-blown sociopath]], but also [[AdaptationalIntelligence a lot smarter and creative]]. As a result, the alternate version of Homelander frequently clashes with Justice League, either by openly fighting them or by plotting for ways to usurp and replace Superman. He's also actively opposed by Team America and the Broforce, who don't approve of his dishonest displays of patriotism.
** Darkseid has repeatedly shown an interest in recruiting Homelander to work for him, with some even saying that Darkseid had a hand in the Seven's ascension for that specific purpose. While Homelander's regular personality hasn't shown any desire to join Darkseid, his alternate personality expressed an interest in a team-up, if only to further his own goals.
** Much like him, Jiren was a nigh-invincible being presented as his world's ultimate superhero only to turn out incredibly self-absorbed without much care for his teammates. Unlike him, Jiren was a goal-oriented[[note]]moreso in the manga[[/note]] and power-obsessed[[note]]moreso in the anime[[/note]] cynic [[spoiler:who finally had someone beat sense into him]], not a hedonistic egomaniac. As such, when Homelander approached Jiren about a potential alliance, he was promptly rebuffed and called a disgrace. Homelander's alternate personality has tried to kill Jiren with EyeBeams on several occasions, only for the heat of Jiren's aura to dissolve them every time.
* Exclusive to Queen Maeve:
** The official backstory of Queen Maeve states that she was born the ruler of a fantastic world, known as the Netherworld and that she chose to use her incredible power to bring the peace and the harmony her world knew to Earth, which was hurt by violence and war. Arriving on Earth, she joined the Seven, becoming a feminist icon and without a doubt the most powerful woman on the planet, a true heroine who could be an inspiration for all girls.
** Unlike her teammates, Maeve initially started out wanting to do some good. However, after the Seven's disastrous mishandling in trying to stop the 9/11 attacks, Maeve developed a deep hatred for her teammates and found two new life reasons that kept her busy: alcohol and sex. She had always some fan who willingly acted as her slave, while she hired bodybuilders to have orgies with them. All the while, she drank unbelievable amounts of gin, spending all of her time drunk and angry with the world.
** Maeve is on reasonably amicable terms with Wonder Woman. While Diana initially distrusted Maeve and disapproved of her alcoholism and apathy, she warmed up to her after learning about the circumstances that led to Maeve becoming like that and how she [[spoiler:sacrificed herself by fighting against Homelander in order to allow Starlight to safely escape]]. Maeve's alternate personality, being [[AdaptationalNiceGuy nicer]] and [[KnightInSourArmor genuinely wanting to save people even though her experiences have left her jaded]], tends to be a more active hero and frequently teams up with Diana.
** Maeve can often be found in the Hall of Alcohol, trying out various drinks. She's managed to become drinking buddies with Bacchus, Cana Alberona, and Tsunade, each of who often encourages her to lighten up and try to become more active as a hero once again.
** [[NamedAfterSomebodyFamous The inspiration for her name]], the Irish queen Medb, is already ascended, and while they have some personality clashes (Medb loves to kill people without qualms, while Maeve might be an EmptyShell but has at least some morals) are still fond of each other, being both powerful women [[ReallyGetsAround with busy sex lives]], and can be seen together sharing drinks and picking up men. 
* Exclusive to Black Noir:
** Even in the fictional story produced by Vought-American, Black Noir was regarded as a living mystery, a true enigma. A dark and troubled hero, he was said to come from the "darkest city" and had the craziest and most sadistic enemies, such as Sexface or Coagula (all paid by V-A like he was, of course). Even his powers were never truly explained, aside from him being immensely strong and supposedly a skilled pilot (the latter was later proven to be definitely false, as he immediately crashed everything he tried to pilot). He was a mystery even for his fellow "heroes" from the Seven, and nobody understood why he was considered part of the Big Three along with the Homelander and Queen Maeve if he never said a word and never did anything worthy of notice.
** The reason behind Black Noir's presence within the Seven was ultimately revealed to be [[spoiler:because he was a perfect clone of Homelander, developed using even more massive doses of Compound V, making him even more powerful than the most powerful man on Earth. Raised in solitude, away from the others, so that even Homelander didn't know about his existence, Black Noir was assigned with a very critical task: he was the contingency plan in case the Homelander became a liability for V-A and was instructed to kill him as soon as the company ordered him to. Although he certainly didn't lack the power to do so, there was something that V-A hadn't considered: spending years in close proximity of his target, even pretending to be his friend, and never being allowed to fulfill his life goal, drove him completely mad. His teammates believed him to be mute, but the truth was that he had a psycho smile on his face all the time, that didn't allow him to speak in an understandable way. [[CompleteMonster He was irredeemably and totally crazy]]]].
** When his alternate personality takes control, Black Noir reverts back to being not only quiet and speechless but also generally FightsLikeANormal. This version is also on much better terms with Homelander, generally following his orders without displaying any inclinations to want to kill him. 
** Being a twisted and insane version of Batman, he quickly became allies with the Joker, the Batman Who Laughs and Kefka Palazzo. Although Joker finds Black Noir entertaining and has complimented him on how he [[spoiler:gaslit Homelander into becoming a monster]], [[EvenEvilHasStandards even he]] finds some of the crimes that Black Noir committed, such as [[spoiler:eating babies and raping women]], to be "improper" and unfunny. On the other hand, the Batman Who Laughs views Black Noir as a worthwhile ally and only refrained from inviting him to join forces with the Dark Knights due to the fact that the Devastator would inevitably try to kill him. Similarly, Kefka admires Black Noir's destructive power and the two frequently team up to cause mayhem and chaos together.
** Black Noir is on good terms with Bizarro, Vanitas, Albedo, Metal Sonic and Mechagodzilla due to being [[spoiler:Homelander's evil clone]]. Bizarro, in particular, thinks of him as a kindred spirit. The others, while [[spoiler:not clones themselves]], can relate to him for wanting to eliminate his counterpart. This is especially true for Metal Sonic, who was similarly [[spoiler:created to kill the one he's based on]].
** Unsurprisingly, Batman tends to keep a close eye on Black Noir, recognizing him as a corrupt version of himself. Through his cooperation with the Boys, Batman hopes to develop counter-measures against Black Noir for whenever they have to deal with him. Similarly, Black Noir's nature as [[spoiler:Homelander's clone]] also drew the attention of Conner Kent, who pities Black Noir for the circumstances of his origin but nonetheless opposes him due to the monster that he has since become.
** The fact that he's committed acts of [[spoiler:rape and infanticide]] drew the interest of Molag Bal, who frequently tempts him into committing such acts even more. However, much to Molag Bal's frustration, Black Noir's single-minded focus on [[spoiler:killing Homelander]] causes him to generally ignore anything else that wouldn't get him closer to that goal.
* Exclusive to The Deep:
** According to the official story published by Vought-American, The Deep was born in a submarine kingdom, an ancient and remote place of mystery and magic, but was raised on the surface world, becoming a man with two souls. As an adult, he became the King of the Seas but heroically chose to use his amazing powers to serve and protect the people of the United States of America (and the seas, sometimes). Somewhere down the line, he was cursed with an ancient Atlantean spell and, from that day on, he was forced to wear a deep-sea diver suit, otherwise, he could die breathing regular air.
** Not one of the so-called Big Three, the Deep always remained somewhat far from the spotlight, having a decent fanbase but not enough popularity to become so attention-craving and spoiled as his teammates. Following the Seven's failed attempt to stop the 9/11 attacks, the Deep subsequently always refused to participate in similar missions and would always be against helping others, even if it was just a matter of helping a kitten down a tree. Apart from money issues, that usually put him against his teammates, he often acted as the voice of reason among a crowd of grown-up babies. However, he himself was not exactly innocent or pure, as he still participated in the annual [[HookersAndBlow Herogasm]] and joined forces with A-Train, Black Noir and Jack From Jupiter when they all nearly raped Starlight to "teach her a lesson".
** The Deep frequently visits the House of Commerce, offering to sell his services to whoever wishes to hire him, although he tends to get annoyed when people assume that he's [[ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaman only useful around water]]. He's been hired by both Mr. Burns and Mr. Krabs to do commercials for their products and, occasionally, to serve as their bodyguard. However, the fact that neither of them pay him decently often irritates him.
** Although far from heroic, the Deep does have a soft spot for marine life. As a result, he became enemies with Hexxus, whose desire to pollute [[CardCarryingVillain for the hell of it]] would result in most of the marine life dying in a PollutedWasteland.
** Other rulers of the sea, such as Aquaman, Namor and King Triton, are unsure what to make of him. Although they don't really like him, the fact that he doesn't really do anything or threaten their authority typically results in them just ignoring him. However, whenever the Deep changes into his alternate personality, who is noticeably [[AdaptationalVillainy eviler]], they tend to oppose him a lot more, although the fact that he's [[TheChewToy rather pathetic]] tends to make their confrontations rather one-sided.
* Exclusive to Jack From Jupiter:
** Supposedly an alien from Jupiter, the shallow and obnoxious Jack has only over sought a life of decadent hedonism. Despite his status as a long-time member of the world's most successful superteam, his lack of the star appeal of some of his colleagues, as well as their violent excesses or major powers, means he is seen as fairly unimportant both by his corporate sponsors and by the Boys. His teammates likewise see him as unimportant, as they are as self-absorbed as he is. Even the newer recruit A-Train, who Jack took under his wing to some extent, has little attachment to him. Although Jack is one of the more innocuous members of the Seven, he probably shouldn't be regarded as a decent individual, as he is aware of the violent crimes and fatal accidents they cause but shows no concern about them, even playing them down and treating these incidents like jokes.
** Being regarded as even less important than the Deep, Jack From Jupiter generally isn't kept under surveillance. His only real ally is Desire of the Endless, although even they seem to mostly hang out with him for the sake of mercilessly [[TheTease teasing]] him. However, no matter how often Jack propositions them for sex, Desire always responds by saying that WantingIsBetterThanHaving.
** Due to having a fetish for pre-op transsexual women, Jack is often seen going after pretty much anyone who is intersex, transgender or otherwise ambiguous. Yubel, Crona, Poison and Chevalier d'Eon are among those who had to deal with shrugging off his advances.
** Jack has faced opposition and criticism from both Martian Manhunter and Shazam. They not only frequently call him out on how he generally doesn't really do anything heroic and only cares about himself, but are especially appalled by the derisive comments he's made [[PoliticallyIncorrectVillain about certain groups]] [[HeManWomanHater of people]]. However, Jack typically just shrugs them off, remarking that he doesn't care about what they think of him.
* Exclusive to A-Train:
** The story printed by Vought-American tells that A-Train was once the sidekick and protégé of Mister Marathon, struck by lightning and blessed with super-speed just like he was. In reality, he was just a young man who was injected with Compound V and by chance obtained the same powers of one of the Seven. As young as he was, he was assigned to Teenage Kix, a team of juvenile delinquents who spent their time between drugs and extreme sex orgies, but who were regarded by the public as young heroes tormented by existential problems. Following the death of Mister Marathon during the Seven's failed attempt to stop the 9/11 attacks, A-Train was asked by V-A to leave the Teenage Kix and join The Seven. A-Train didn't think about it twice and accepted the offer, ready to play with the big guys... and discovering that the rules were just the same as those of the little ones, with drugs and sex and more drugs being a constant in his days. Although his time was mainly filled with press conferences and public events, on some days he was also asked to do some heroic stuff, such as fighting supervillains and making photos for the police. during one of those days, he chased a supervillain to Scotland and knocked him out by throwing him against a wall at full speed, inadvertently reducing an innocent woman named Robin to a bloody pulp in the process.
** A-Train has frequently clashed with other speedsters such as both Flashes and Sonic the Hedgehog, who were horrified to learn of how reckless he was with his powers and how he tried to rape Starlight. In his alternate personality, he develops a [[InferioritySuperiorityComplex strong need to be the best]] and frequently tries to get his hands on various {{Super Serum}}s throughout the Pantheon in an effort to defeat his rivals, which often results in him damaging himself more than them.
** He's also enemies with Reverse-Flash and Zoom, although neither of them takes him seriously. They both view him as a corrupt and weaker version of The Flash, and fights between him and them often conclude with him getting seriously injured. However, A-Train is strongly determined to defeat them and intends to go after them after he manages to finally beat the Flashes.
* Exclusive to Starlight:
** Rebecca Anne "Annie" January was born in a very conservative Christian family, who knew since her birth that she was special, declaring her a gift from God to humanity. As her mother had been exposed to dangerous doses of Compound V during her pregnancy, Annie had powers, and the moment she was born, she blinded the woman with the bright light emanating from her body. As a teenager, she became Starlight and joined the Young Americans, a group of young superheroes sponsored by Vought-American collecting conservative and religious teens like her. One day, she was contacted to replace the Lamplighter, a recently deceased member of the Seven, and she accepted the offer, finally seeing the chance to be the heroine she had always dreamt to be. However, shortly after arriving at the Seven's headquarters, she was pressured by Homelander, Black Noir and A-Train into giving them oral sex if she really wanted the job. Immediately after the ordeal, Starlight escaped to the woman's bathroom, experiencing physical illness at the events that had occurred. She met Queen Maeve and tried to bond with her with feminine solidarity, but she found only a cold and detached insensibility on Maeve's side. Initially accepting her teammates' abuse, she grew to defend herself against their actions as well as refusing changes Vought-American tried to force upon her.
** Being the only unambiguously heroic member of the Seven, Starlight was overjoyed to discover that the heroes in the Pantheon were genuinely nice people who shared her ideals. She's on very good terms with Power Girl, Supergirl, Starfire and Captain Marvel, each of whom respects her ability to remain a good person despite the [[BlackAndGrayMorality cynical nature of her world]].
** She was surprised to learn that there was someone else in the Pantheon named Starlight, and even more so when she discovered that the other Starlight was a [[YouCanTalk talking pony]]. After getting to know Starlight Glimmer, Starlight was happy to learn about how she [[HeelFaceTurn had turned good]] and [[TheAtoner seeks to atone for her past transgressions]]. The two have occasionally been seen hanging out together.
** She has managed to bond with other rape victims such as Casca, Queen Medb and Mitsuko Souma, who feel bad that she was forced to have sex just so she could join her team and do heroic acts. They quickly became enemies with Homelander, Black Noir and A-Train (especially the latter two) and frequently come to Starlight's aid whenever she ends up opposing them.

* Opposed by: [[Pantheon/{{Leadership}} Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Pantheon/OtherPowers Miles Morales/Spider-Man III]]
* Conflicting Opinion: [[Pantheon/{{Philosophy}} Diana of Themyscira/Wonder Woman]]
* Odd Friendship: [[Pantheon/CulturalValues Hank Hill]]
* Stephen's road to ascension was rather simple. He discovered the Pantheon and willed himself into being a god. Of course, his already loyal fanbase helped out a lot. So much that he was given a second temple for just how easy he can boost the popularity of whatever he discusses. Now, he seeks to clarify the Pledge of Allegiance by rewording it to "One nation under Stephen."
* As the God of Truthiness, the true nature of his shtick has been widely discussed with in the Pantheon. For some people, he is the real man continuing the act long after the show has ended. For others, he is the personification made real for better or worse. Yet most people would agree that Colbert is downright hilarious to watch.
* Has long been the archrival of Jon Stewart and [[Series/TheDailyShowWithJonStewart The Daily Show]]. Now only did the two exchange jabs throughout their shows' runs, they also competed for critical acclaim. Colbert prides himself over winning more Emmy awards as well as ascending before Jon. Yet once their shows ended, the two mended bridges and became friends. Colbert even helped Jon Stewart ascend by taking over the role of {{Satire}}, a position long sought after by Colbert.
* He occasionally hosts reports on the efforts of the GUAE and GUAG, [[SarcasmMode encouraging "Colbert Nation" to throw their support behind Melkor]]. Neither organization can tell whether he's genuine or not. "[[ObviouslyEvil Look]] [[TinTyrant at]] [[EvilOverlord this guy]]. Now this is a man who [[TakeThat stands for true conservative American ideals]]."
* Continuing from his show, Colbert brought back the popular 'Threatdown' segment to highlight the top 5 biggest threats to the Pantheon. The House of Defense largely frowns upon the list. First of all, all the threats he lists appear to be less about the Pantheon in general than about Colbert himself. Second of all, at least one subject is a bear or robot deity, with Bashmaster and Ultron often topping the list.
* Took the assassination of Captain America hard, so much that he took the shield for himself for the time being. Steve Rogers thanked Colbert upon his return and let the commentator keep a copy of the shield. The superhero believes that under all of that braying is a good man. It's... just extremely hard to find.
* Not to be outdone, Aragon handed Colbert a copy of Andúril. Instead, Colbert referred it to as a 'letter opener'. The Man of the West was not pleased with this and has tried to get his sword back, but Colbert has buried case under litigation to this day.
* When he eventually found Peter Parker's temple, he gushed about being the web-crawler's biggest fan. Spider-Man took the compliment in stride, but was careful not to be too attached given his nature. That was when Colbert said he "forgives" him not only for letting Obama "bribe" them into his comic, but also the creation of Miles Morales. Safe to say the new Ultimate Spider-Man was not pleased with this and has banned Colbert from his temple.
* Believes that Wonder Woman represents yet another line of patriotic superheroes created at the time to counteract against Nazi propaganda. With that said, he is concerned that a number of women see her as a feminist icon, especially when a gust came by explaining the Secret History of Wonder Woman. Diana herself diplomatically insisted that she remains a symbol for all good people, but admits she has a soft spot for good-nature women.
* Was initially excited that a Republican managed to snag the role of Badass Presidents. When he met to see who it was, the president rebuked him. Turns out it was Teddy Roosevelt who wasn't that to keen with the party trying to reduce the amount of parks in the country. Stephen wrote him off as a 'false prophet' and the two have been feuding ever since.
* When Bandit Keith was invited to the show, he hoped that a fellow American patriot would help repair his name which was getting dragged in the mud by Yugioh and his friends. Instead, he made his way into a roasting as Colbert berated him for needing to cheat in order to get by, stating no true American would resort to that. The subsequent ColbertBump made him even more of a laughing stock. The duelist now plans to sue the host for libel.
* There was a time when Hank Hill thought it was an actual news site on Comedy Central. When he found out it was actually {{Satire}}, he was upset that he was made a fool of. All of that changed when Stephen Colbert himself ascended. Colbert made the time to talk to him afterwards. No one knows what happened, but Hank came out much happier afterwards. The two maintain connections with each other.
* In 2014, The House of Heroes received a card from what was said to be Prince Hawkcat, 'Half Hawk, Half Cat, Whole Prince'. A few days later, the superhero stated his case for the Pantheon. Safe to say, it didn't go well with him failing nearly every trial. It didn't take long before Trollkaiger identified the man as Stephen Colbert himself in an attempt to build a new temple there. Angered, Colbert dedicated an entire episode revealing embarrassing secrets from the members there.
* It should be noted that Colbert has since retired ''Series/TheColbertReport'' to replace David Letterman as host of the ''Series/TheLateShow'', also abandoning most of his character persona in favour of less satirical commentary on current Pantheon events, citing being tired of maintaining said persona. He now runs his own version of ''Series/TheLateShowWithStephenColbert'' in the House of Pantheon/TheatreAndSpectacle.
