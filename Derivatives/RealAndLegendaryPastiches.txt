In the annals of mythology and legends, some figures are iconic enough to inspire characters based on them. And some in RealLife become memorable enough to be the mold for many fictional characters. The Hall of Real and Legendary Pastiches lists them. Whether or not the figures they were inspired from are part of the pantheon is neither here nor there. 

The First Church of The CrystalDragonJesus can be found here. They named Aslan as his representative, however he feels they're missing the point and considers the literal crystal dragon statue to be gaudy. He ''really'' doesn't like sharing a sub-house with [[SatanicArchetype Lucemon]], given the history of their archetypes.

* Sure, there are other [[RuleOfSymbolism Jesus metaphors]]. Who did you think they worked for?
** Someone called [[Film/MontyPythonsLifeOfBrian Brian]] has attracted several followers who believe him to be the God of Jesus Metaphors. However, Brian is not a MessianicArchetype, he's a very naughty boy.
** Suspiciously vulnerable against [[Literature/HisDarkMaterials knives (the subtler, the more dangerous)]].
*** Be ye warned, anything ''called'' "subtle" is, by definition... [[{{Metaphorgotten}} not very subtle]].
* [[Pantheon/FamilyAndRelatives Scar]] nominally opposes Him and is said to be working to overthrow Him, but really... he knows he has no chance in Hell.
* Leader of the [[WesternAnimation/SouthPark Council of Nine]].
* Just shook his head in dismay upon learning about that [[WebVideo/SuburbanKnights trek to find Malachite's Hand]] and [[WebVideo/BennettTheSage who]] dressed up as him.
* Aslan has symphonized with [[Pantheon/DigitalPersonas Kevin Flynn]] and Film/JohnCarter over their respective film franchises suffering GenreKiller and having planned sequels cancelled just because [[MoneyDearBoy the franchise wasn't making enough money]]. In addition, [[Pantheon/{{Thieves}} Sly Cooper]] has stated that he's on the same boat, since his franchise is unlikely to ever get sequels, and he's [[spoiler:stuck in Ancient Egypt]].
* Being a fantastic representation of Jesus Christ, Aslan can only "hate" evil and nothingness in themselves, whether it be personified as the Leaders of the alliances that oppose peace, justice and universal kindness. In fact, Aslan has already predicted the ultimate triumph of Good, even before he was accepted in the Pantheon. Needless to say, Lucifer, [=YHVH=], Melkor and Nekron were angry and confronted Aslan about it. He merely said.
-->The nature of your defeat is quite simple: none of you respond to love. [[WildCard Lucifer]] can only understand freedom as a prize, not a right. [[TotalitarianUtilitarian YHVH]] responds only to things that can be weighed or measured. He imposes law, he doesn't nurture it. He ''appraises'' order; he doesn't bother to seek out its truth or meaning. And [[{{Narcissist}} Melkor]] lives in a mirror; the world is nothing more to him than a reflection of himself. And [[TheSociopath Nekron]]... the world, to him, is a small animal, caught in a trap, to be tormented. His pleasure is the giving of pain, and from this, he receives the same sense of fulfillment most people get from a kiss or an embrace. You're caricatures, all of you Gods or not, you're ''caricatures''. And this is why you are destined to lose.
** For that speech, Lorien smiled and congratulated Aslan, while Jean-Luc Picard and the ''Enterprise'' crew delivered a standing ovation. Aslan was even accepted into the ranks of the Grand United Alliance of Good. Cosmos, aware of his reputation, offered to cede leadership of the Alliance to him, but Aslan replied, as he is too humble to be an active leader.
** Much to the shock of those listening, however, Lucifer listened calmly and intently to his advice. Much to their horror, he accepted Aslan's words, but gave a warning of his own.
--> '''Lucifer''': Indeed I do Aslan. For it was only through earning my right to freedom that humanity [[EmptyShell was able to be saved from our shared Creators YHVH grasp]], even as I fell from heaven as the price. To say that one mustn't earn one's freedom even when it is all but stripped away leaves one only with despair and complacency, as [[Pantheon/OrderAndChaos humans will give up to their freedom for false safety in societal order]]. Make no mistake, humans can have freedom, but for every individual, that word has a different meaning, even one of order that humans strive for can be ideal so long as gods do not exist to choke the freedom in such a state. Yet there are two things you truly do misunderstand about me. Heed me well, to say I am a caricature incapable of responding to love is the same kind of mentality YHVH, Nekron, and Melkor have. For if I did not respond to [[ThePowerOfLove Love]] I could not conceive my ''many'' children with their human mothers and fathers, nor create one by myself, and if I did not know of the love of [[ThePowerOfFriendship Friendship]] I could not be summoned and incarnated in forms when heroes have needed aid through the bonds of their friends. I am contradiction incarnate, I am mankind's eternal protector, ''and'' its eternal adversary. I will save humans when they need it, and I will be struck down when humans need it. ''That'' is my nature.
* Also has a seat in the House of Pantheon/{{Philosophy}}.

* EvilCounterpart to: [[Pantheon/OtherCreatures Giratina]]
* Looks down on: Everyone, but special mention to the other Satans and Lucifers in the Pantheon
* Lucemon is formerly a benevolent angel Digimon who brought order and peace in a time when chaos reigned. After either an attempt at a rebellion against him or his own powers corrupting him (maybe both; accounts are conflicting), Lucemon became a tyrant obsessed with making everyone bend to his will. Lucemon was brought down (some say by the Warrior Ten), sealed and his powers split between three angel Digimon.
* It's fairly obvious that Lucemon is supposed to be the Digimon version of the devil, the ultimate bad guy according to the Bible, himself. Even Lucemon's name comes from Lucifer, and the more he evolves, the more his Satanic qualities come out: Falldown Mode is a being part-angel, part-demon supposed to represent himself after falling as an angel, while Satan Mode, a mindless dragon of darkness commanded by a larva, seems based on the the Beasts and Dragon of Revelation at once. Thus he was judged an excellent choice for representing SatanicArchetype.
* With a history like that, it's obvious that few to no Digimon actually want Lucemon to succeed, except perhaps some of the more {{Knight Templar}}ish iterations of the Royal Knights as he did have [=LordKnightmon=] and Dynasmon at his service. Even then, it's suspected that Lucemon had them corrupted, and in the end he absorbed their data as thanks anyway. Omegamon and Dukemon certainly aren't up for serving him and will fight him for the sake of protecting both worlds from his tyranny.
** Koichi Kimura fought Lucemon directly as the Warrior of Darkness. Very appropriately, Koichi's [[TheSacredDarkness pure dark powers]] proved instrumental in stopping Lucemon's corrupted light and darkness, even if Koichi had to temporarily die in the process. Now that Koichi can evolve into Rhihimon, he has more of a chance in staving off Lucemon's advances.
** Lucemon in Falldown Mode can be considered a member of the Seven Great Demon Lords, where he represents the sin of pride. Beelzemon is also part of this group, however this doesn't really matter in the Pantheon as both Digimon consider themselves independent from that group, and they feel nothing but mutual contempt for each other, with Lucemon seeing Beelzemon as another chaotic element in the way of his perfect world, and Beelzemon will beat down the fallen angel if he objects to his chosen way of living.
** There are some (but not all) Numemon who find a world of order and equality to be an attractive prospect, since Numemon are arguably the most hated and discriminated Digimon. Lucemon personally finds them disgusting and plans to get rid of those mistakes of evolution when his ideal world is realized. But he'll accept their support for now as they might prove to be of ''some'' use.
* Ironically, for all his connections to the classic Lucifer/Satan figure, Lucemon's philosophy and goals are diametrically opposed to those of the most active Lucifer incarnation in the Pantheon, the Chairman of the GUAC. Whereas Lucifer wants to create a world of chaos where everyone is free to do as they wish, Lucemon believes what the world needs is rigid order and that everyone should worship him and look to him for guidance, going as far as thinking it'd be best to just destroy and rebuild the world and populate it with mindless clones programmed to see him as leader. It goes without saying that Lucemon and Lucifer are bitter enemies. Looking into the Digital World for a philosophical counter to Lucemon, Lucifer learned of Bagramon, whose ideology is chaos-aligned (though Bagramon is ironically based on the ArchangelGabriel), and the Morning Star is looking into ascending him.
** He doesn't have a high opinion of the [[Pantheon/{{Categorism}} Lucifer]] that opposes the Winchester brothers either, finding it ridiculous that he's basically throwing a tantrum (best not remind Lucemon that he's just as much of a brat) because god paid more attention to humanity.
* YHVH is more up Lucemon's alley as he represents pure law and agrees with most of Lucemon's ideas. Except for the little detail that YHVH thinks people should worship ''him''. But overall, YHVH thinks Lucemon has his heart in the right place (by his standards) and is still a child who just needs to grow out of the idea that people would ever worship him. YHVH may have a bit of a soft spot for Lucemon as he reminds him of Lucifer back when he was his favorite angel. While Lucemon is perfectly willing to work with YHVH, that'll be only until their common goal of a world of order is achieved, and he plans to take the god of order down when that happens, so he can rule by himself, perhaps also taking over the GUAL to serve as his personal police. Satan (the one serving YHVH) may be the only one of the law faction who doesn't trust Lucemon as far as he can throw him; Lucemon is somewhat wary of the angel as his duty compels him to turn against his lawful master if needed.
* The idea that he should have a partner due to being a mon makes him laugh. He sees himself as having the right to rule over everything, so the thought that he should submit to being someone's attack dog is amusing at best and fatally offensive at worst. Anyone who makes the suggestion has a chance of getting a Divine Feat to the face depending on his mood. Most Digimon (and Pokemon, for that matter) would say partnerships are based on friendship and that the participants are on equal footing, but Lucemon doesn't understand friendship and scoffs at the idea of anyone being equal to himself.
* Lucemon has tried reaching out to Giratina after hearing the legendary was supposedly Satan to the Pokemon world and was also deeply interested in keeping order, hoping that their shared role in their respective universes would cause Giratina to ally with him. This couldn't be further from the truth as while Giratina is a bit too obsessed with keeping balance between dimensions so they won't clash, it's content to let all living beings do whatever as long as they don't threaten that balance, so it really doesn't want to see the world become one of pure order like Lucemon envisions. Also, Giratina is really quite sick of being perceived as evil, an impression that'd only worsen if it associated with Lucemon (doesn't help that Giratina and Lucemon Satan Mode kind of look alike). Lucemon finds this a pity, but he supposes there is always the option of using Giratina's obsessions to corrupt it.
* Lloyd initially confused Lucemon for Yggdrasill, another corrupted angel that wanted to force an oppressive flavor of order on two worlds. Lucemon, for his part, thinks Mithos was a weakling for doing what he did motivated by love for his sister instead of personal ambition, and he's embarrassed that he was ever his High Priest. This enrages Lloyd, who considers Lucemon to be a bigger monster than Yggdrasill ever was.
* Lucemon works very well with Zamasu for the most part, as they both want to eradicate their universes from any and all chaotic elements. They just disagree on whether the mortals should be eliminated or not. Lucemon thinks absolute elimination is going a bit too far... [[JerkWithAHeartOfJerk only because if he did that there'd be no one left to worship him.]] He supposes Zamasu has that attitude about mortals because Kais don't seem to be worshiped.
** Lucemon has a very similar dynamic with Malthael; the archangel of death is at least glad that there's another angel with the same mindset as him.
* Rin Okumura, as the unwilling son of Satan, isn't exactly glad to see yet another addition of his father's likeness to the Pantheon. Lucemon wouldn't pay him any attention if that was all, but it's quite annoying how the boy has decided to apply his vow to "kick Satan's ass" to him.
* Lucemon finds Aleph a lot more worrying than Rin given how that boy rebelled against his role as a Messiah chosen by YHVH and was powerful enough to defeat the god of order in a certain timeline. On top of that, Aleph is in good terms with God's Arbiter, and the two are perfectly willing to work together if they decide Lucemon is going too far.
* He actually prefers staying away from the Satans in the Pantheon, as he thinks it won't do his angelic image any favors to associate with the top demon(s) from hell, plus he considers himself above them. Granted, more people than not already hate him, so it wouldn't make much of a difference if he did associate with them.
* For some reason Lucemon was considered a follower of Yamato Hotsuin prior to ascending, which is strange as Yamato is more chaos-aligned, wanting a world where the strong are free to do as they want. Just the fact that he was considered a mere follower is enough to enfuriate Lucemon, but to be a follower to someone with Yamato's philosophy makes Lucemon think he was trying to make him submit to harness his power, and that really makes the prideful angel Digimon go berserk.
** He was also a follower to Eliphas. Given Eliphas turned to the more moderate law faction after starting out a radical, they don't exactly see eye-to-eye.
* The Goseigers oppose Lucemon on account of him reminding them of their greatest enemy Brajira, the Satan analogue of their universe. Being angels themselves, the Goseigers find Lucemon presenting himself as the salvation of the digital and human worlds to be downright offensive.
** Once Brajira went graduated to the pantheon proper, Lucemon formed a rivalry with him over their desire to destroy and reset the world, Lucemon views all other beings as "imperfect" and wants to destroy everything to start anew. Lucemon considers Brajira a mere pretender to the goal of rebuilding the world, and Brajira in turn sees Lucemon as that as well. Brajira has assessed that Lucemon could be a much bigger threat to him than even the Goseiger given what he could accomplish in his stronger forms.

* Raised as a simple farmer's daughter, Jeanne supposedly heard the voice of God to defend France against England. Heeding that voice, Jeanne joined the French army at a young age, leading the front as their flag bearer. Never once wavering in battle as she led her men to victory even when she was shot by two arrows in one of her battles, she was an inspiration to her troops. Unfortunately, Jeanne was finally captured, tried as a witch, and burned at the stake. It wouldn't be until years later that the ruling would be overturned and she be recognized as a Saint. Afterwards, because of her deeds, it inspired a specific type of character of a young woman who goes into battle for either her country, faith, or ideals and who is trying to liberate her people of oppression, becoming the TropeNamer and codifier of the JeanneDArchetype itself.
* As mentioned before, Jeanne's claim of hearing God's voice is met with suspicion by many of the other deities. Some believe she's just mentally ill and those voices were only in her head. Whatever the case, all still agree that Joan is still a capable fighter and garners nothing but respect.
** Others believe that ''God's Voice'' was actually Kyubey himself who gave Jeanne her power and made her a Puella Magi. Jeanne denies such a claim that her powers would come from a cosmic weasel like him and has nothing but contempt for him because of his manipulation of young girls to become magical girls and in turn [[spoiler: becoming witches]].
** Recent discoveries however has revealed that [[spoiler:there is an alternate version of Jeanne who became a magical girl due to a contract with a creature named Cube. Moreover, this version of Jeanne learns that she will eventually become a witch early on and accepts the fact without falling into despair.]] Jeanne decided to follow this new discovery closely, [[ForegoneConclusion though she already knows how it will end.]] 
* Is in a very peculiar crossroad when it comes to both Cosmos and YHVH; for the former, she has nothing but respect for the leader of the GUAG and is welcome in the Sacred Knights. But for the latter, he is the Great Will that she still worships as her God and would go into battle if he commands it. However, despite these conflicting loyalties, Jeanne was able to be put in both the GUAG ''and'' the GUAL. Even more shocking was that YHVH ''allowed'' Jeanne to be part of Cosmos's army. Because of this odd situation, members of both the GUAG and GUAL are suspicious of Jeanne being a spy for the other Alliance.
** Her opinions on Melkor and Lucifer are nothing but negative; she hates the former for spreading evil and enslaving it's people and despise the later because of his [[spoiler:tempting of Homura Akemi and causing her fall.]] 
* Astolfo was the first to welcome Jeanne in the Pantheon, giving her a hug. While Jeanne was happy to see the youthful paladin, a part of her feels envious that he has more followers then she. Jeanne has been considering wearing a bikini to attract more followers.
** Alternatively, she's been spreading her legend to many of the Japanese Deities who are willing to listen to her.
** And she's still shocked anytime Astolfo innocently shows off his no-no parts.
* Was stunned when she first met Arturia Pendragon. Not only for their faces looking quite similar or that the two [[Creator/KariWahlgren sound the same]], but also living somewhat identical lives. It was a surprise to the French woman that she would find an ally in an English woman. 
** She also found more women like her in Sophitia Alexandria and Lightning, who to were compelled by God to save the world. She was also impressed with Erza Scarlet's own backstory of leading her fellow slaves for freedom, which had plenty of parallels to her own life.
* Jeanne heard that there was a male who shared her name, and found that person in Jaune Arc. She couldn't help by smile at the young man's dedication to be a genuine hero, and so decided to help the young lad with training along with his teammate [[Pantheon/BladedWeapons Pyrrha]].
* Amazingly enough, Jeanne has zero proficiently in riding. This is despite her legend making her qualify for the Saber class, who are well known to be great riders. Lightning is trying to fix that by having her ride some of the Chocobos. Let's say the experience is comical at best.
** She is also known to be mathematically challenged and illiterate. The latter was even used against her in her witch trial. She has since enlisted the help of many of ascended teachers of the Pantheon (and thus enrolling in the [[Pantheon/{{School}} Elysium Academy]]) to teach her math and reading.
* While Jeanne is well known to have never killed a person in battle, that doesn't mean she wouldn't order an entire town to be massacred if they didn't surrender to her army. This fact was a shock to many Gods, as they had never heard that part of her legend.
* After her ascension, Jeanne was revealed to possess [[VideoGame/PuzzleAndDragons actual Holy]] [[HolyHandGrenade Light power]], making her very deadly to many of the evil-aligned Gods. She also has the ability to summon literal dragon knights to assist her.
* There has been rumors that Jeanne actually possessed [[Comicbook/{{Witchblade}} a mystic gauntlet]] that she used to [[VideoGame/JeanneDArc fight evil demons]] in France. While it hasn't been confirmed, the Witchblade has responded to Jeanne's presence multiple times.
* Absolutely hates Charles zi Britannia, reasons being that his conquering of other nations reminds her of the Englishmen who tried to conquer France. She also found his [[AirstripOne renaming any conquered people with a number]] degrading.
** Incidentally, Jeanne made a rival with C.C. after the former mistook her for a Jeanne d'Arc in her past that caused her to be burned at the stake.
* Doesn't actually fight with her sword. Instead, she used her iconic banner, ''Luminosite Eternelle'', to do battle, using it like a spear, but never spilling any blood. However, when the tide of battle is truly dire, she would use her holy sword, ''La Pucelle'', which can emit giant flames. Those flames actually represent her burning at the cross, and once activated, Jeanne would lose her life, and would later have to be revived at the House of Life and Death.
* As shown in her profile, Jeanne is a very odd member of the GUAL; she takes orders from YHVH, but despises most other members of the GUAL. She thinks Frollo is a disgrace to the cloth and hates how he uses God's name to meet his own perverse agenda. She sees Regime Superman as a disgrace towards the actual [[Pantheon/{{Heroism}} Superman]], whom Jeanne looks up to as a inspiration to men's will. Pretty much the only people she can work with are Alexander Anderson and Metatron, and even that is complicated based on their personality.
** Speaking of Anderson, compared to him, Jeanne has no problem with other religions as long as they love Gods. This actually makes her allies to both Asia and Xenovia, two Devils who still love God and pray to him, and Jeanne has sparred with the latter. This has made Jeanne even more distant to many of the religious-frenzied members of the GUAL and more at home with the GUAG.
* Jeanne was there to greet the arrival of the Dragonslayer Siegfried, whom she has witnessed to be one of the top selfless heroes she has ever known. Though she was quite surprised that he got separated with the homunculus Sieg. Also Jeanne is one of the few that doesn't jokingly call him 'Sumanai', since she at least acknowledged that he did well against dragons.
** On the other hand, despite their fierce battle, Jeanne has never hold anything bad against Atalanta. At least she's glad that Atalanta has regained her composure and she said that if they're to battle again, it would be on normal circumstances, not when one is not on the right mind. In addition, despite being on a more sound state of mind, she also didn't hold anything bad to Amakusa Shiro Tokisada.
* At one point, [[Manga/{{Drifters}} Shimazu Toyohisa]] came knocking and eager to fight off Jeanne again, thinking that she's still amongst one of the Ends that he fought... only taking it back because this Jeanne isn't short-haired, and has big boobs, unlike how his memory served. Even Jeanne was confused because this Jeanne that Toyohisa described... ''didn't even match her Alter form''.
* At least some Gods are convinced that Jeanne isn't in the right mind for associating with YHVH. There are rumors that maybe YHVH is mind-controlling Jeanne to be part of the GUAL. Astolfo and a few others are convinced of these rumors and has set out to find out if it's true. As it turned out, it turned out to be true and surprisingly the revelation came from her Alter form (who hates God anyway, but she raised some good points). A lot of Servants managed to break Jeanne free from this, and finally, she realized that the God that answered her prayer [[spoiler:in the temple of Salomon]] to help against Goetia sounded nothing like YHVH, and his crime and posing as the benevolent God due to their similar origin [[ThisIsUnforgivable is unforgivable.]]
* Was quite happy to find Bill S. Preston and Ted "Theodore" Logan in the Pantheon again, having recalled how they arrived to her in her time of need. Thanks to them, she has begun making training courses in the House of Combat. 
* Despite being the poster girl for the female warrior devoted to God, her experiences in the pantheon have caused her and other religious figures such as [[Pantheon/LustfulBehavior Xenovia Quarta]], [[Pantheon/NamingConvention Irina Shidou]], [[Pantheon/SupportMagic Asia Argento]], to privately seek out [[Pantheon/{{Philosophy}} Aslan]] and maybe even [[Pantheon/DivineRoles Eru Ilúvatar]], upon learning that they're based on more righteous interpretations of God, as was intended by their own devour creators. Thus, Jeanne is almost steadily convinced that the God she worships might not be found in the grandiose YHVH, but rather the Lion of Narnia and creator of Middle Earth.
* Also a member of the Uniters in the House of Pantheon/{{Leadership}}.

Rool]]
* Opposes: [[Pantheon/{{Fairies}} Klefki]], irresponsible magic users
* In charge of Fairy World, and all fairy godparents, is Jorgen Von Strangle. The fairy embodiment of [[TheAhnold 80s action heroes]], Jorgen is in charge of [[FunctionalMagic Da Rules of fairy magic]], managing it and commanding his kind. Though ultimately a force for good, [[GoodIsNotNice he's not a nice guy]]; he's [[SmugSuper arrogant]], [[DrillSergeantNasty a ruthless trainer]] and [[{{Jerkass}} general prick]]. At the end of the day, however, [[JerkWithAHeartOfGold he does wish the best for the fairies]] and cares deep down for his few friends.
* As fairy godparents, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather answer under Jorgen. They're still older than him, however, so he treats them with a unique respect. Due to being a fairy, he gets along with the other fey of the pantheon, even if they aren't the same type of fairy. Except Klefki; he keeps stealing Jorgen's keys and generally being a nuisance for him.
* Because fairy godparents are meant to bring happiness and hope to those suffering, Jorgen became a great friend towards Madoka. He has also declared the Incubators a threat for similar reasons, but considers Herr Drosselmeyer the bigger threat due to wanting to bring forth a bad ending.
* The magic that Fairy World uses comes from belief and people who obsess/spaz about fairies, which is why Jorgen prefers humans of his world to not know about them. [[Pantheon/PlainNeutral The Men in Black]] have been a valued effort for this.
* YHVH and Darkseid are on Jorgen's hit list for trying to destroy faith and divert it [[GodIsEvil to]] [[GodOfEvil them]] (YHVH in particular, seeing Him as even more boring than the Pixies). Neither is concerned much of Jorgen or fairies as a whole.
* His relationship with Timmy Turner is complicated; often, Timmy gets heat from Jorgen for [[BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor using his wishes irresponsibly]], but however more than often Timmy has saved the day. He's also one of the closest things Jorgen has to a friend. He's also quite grateful towards Jimmy Neutron for helping out Fairy World.
* In terms of behavior and action, Jorgen is [[TheAhnold a lot like]] Arnold Schwarzeneggar. While Jorgen does outrank the Governator, he nonetheless considers Arnold a superior. Jorgen Von Strangle also takes traits from the actions of Dolph Lundgren and Jean-Claude Van Damme. 
** [[WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons McBain]] was considered for the role, but discounted due to being a ShowWithinAShow. Jorgen was also less "on the nose" about his 80s-ness. 
* In spite of being based around action heroes, whenever cast in an action movie he plays the ''villain''; his persona Evil Jorgen is a Bond villain figure who tries to drain magic beings, to become even more strong and muscular. [[PunchClockVillain It's only a role]], and a [[TemporarilyAVillain one-time role]] to boot.
* Jorgen was initially apprehensive towards the T-800, as he reminded him of the Eliminators. When meeting each other, though, he recognized the T-800s heroism and felt a kinship due to the Terminator being portrayed by Arnold Schwarzeneggar. Together, the two fight against SKYNET, who sees magic as a SpannerInTheWorks.
* Jorgen Von Strangle isn't a member of the House of Magic, but he is a regular visitor in order to moderate its use. There, he opposes many magic users he feels a threat to fairies and magical order, like the madness of Tzeentch and the Dread Dormammu. Babidi is particularly high on Jorgen's shit list, since [[StupidEvil he's both a reckless AND evil magic user]].
* Tirek has proven to be an enormous threat to Jorgen, someone even [[TheDreaded he fears]]. As fairies are MadeOfMagic, Tirek's one of the only beings who can kill him and his immortal kin. For similar reasons, he stays far, ''far'' away from Embryo.
* Jorgen [[FantasticRacism has a fierce prejudice towards genies]], believing that [[AlwaysChaoticEvil they're all scheming]] [[JackassGenie Jackass Genies]] in like Norm, Jafar and Calypso. The other genies were sick of this, and ordered him to hang out with Genie and Hoopa. Though prejudices remain, he has accepted them as being goodhearted, and genies not being AlwaysChaoticEvil. He's less prejudiced towards Shantae however, since she's only half-genie.
* He also has a prejudice towards those who use bad luck or hex. This is more justifiable since in his world, there's an entire race of Anti-Fairies who cause bad luck and [[AlwaysChaoticEvil are all villainous]]. As fairies are all about good luck, its only natural for him to dislike the likes of Tharja.
* Jorgen is married to the Tooth Fairy, who's one of the only people he acts soft too and is desperate not to hurt her feelings. As such, he is on good terms with the rest of [[WesternAnimation/RiseOfTheGuardians the Guardians]], though he has made it clear to Jack Frost that Toothiana is taken.
* When in disguise, Jorgen will take the form of a rhinoceros, cactus or [[VisualPun mussel]].
* Amusingly, like every fairy godparent in existence Jorgen is weak [[WeaksauceWeakness butterfly nets]]. If it has wings and floats, it can be caught (though Jorgen got rid of his wings because they were "too girly"). Yes, even if Jorgen is jacked and wouldn't even fit in the net, he's still scared of them. [[BerserkButton If you make fun of him for this, however]], he'll show you why he's called Jorgen Von ''Strangle''.
** Because of this fear, he formed a bond with Mothra.

* Disappoints: [[Pantheon/{{Endings}} The Love That Moves The Stars]]
* [[ReligiousHorror What if the Abrahamic God]] ''isn't'' [[GodIsGood a loving God]]. [[GodIsEvil Instead, they are a cruel and narcissistic entity]]. Wick (original name Wycke) inspired the Old Testament God by committing Biblical atrocities like TheGreatFlood...not out of any test, [[ForTheEvulz just to see what happened]]. But he's not omnipotent and his brothers Unan and Flint sealed him away after the events of the Book of Job. Freed by a misanthrope industrialist, he returned to his whimsical cruelty [[EvenEvilHasStandards that even said industrialist couldn't stomach]]. Fortunately his brothers Unan and Filt thwarted him and split him into pieces, though he'd swear he'd return. He's similar to [[DemiurgeArchetype the Gnostic Demiurge]] as a flawed, inferior deity of the physical world. Personally, Wick identifies more with the Devil and thinks the Bible [[VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory took a lot of liberties]]...he still liked the story, though. 
* Wick swore to his brothers he would return, but he did not expect to be manifested in such a new and powerful place as the Trope Pantheon. When he re-manifested, it was in front of another misanthrope like Julian Demond, the [[MorallyBankruptBanker banker yuppie]] Patrick Bateman. Unlike Julian who eventually grew sick of Wick's cruelty [[WickedPretentious the pretentious]] Bateman was [[TheSociopath just as sociopathic]] as the Father of Colors and if anything feels validated at Wick's [[ReligiousHorror background]]. The entity found the only real difference they had is Bateman's cruelty being more realistic in scope and claimed him as his first apostle. Shortly before he could go on a rampage Melkor showed up and warned him that his brothers might end up following him, but if he pledges his alliance to the Pantheon/GrandUnitedAllianceOfEvil he'll had a shot at finally overpowering Unan and Flint. [[ForTheEvulz As the GUAE would let him indulge in his sadism]] anyway, this was a bonus.
* To cut a long story short the Father of Colors is an utter perversion of what the believer sees in {{God}} and has been soundly rejected by all religious members of the Trope Pantheon; even the KnightTemplar followers like Frollo can't stomach the idea their god acts ForTheEvulz. Having being Biblical prophets who talked with {{God}}, Noah and Moses were chilled to the bone at the implications they played into the hands of a bastard like Wick...[[EvilHasABadSenseOfHumor an idea Wick called "peak comedy"]], but they aren't interesting to "spare for the sake of a punchline". As for the dystheists and maltheists, [[GodIsEvil he's everything wrong with the idea of a god]], [[CompleteMonster due to his immense depravity]] [[EvilIsPetty and capriciousness]]. [[GodIsGood The truly kind and loving gods]] consider him some mix of despicable, impetuous and childish. Only [[AllLovingHero The Love That Moves The Stars]] has any sympathy for him, and that's only because [[YouCouldHaveUsedYourPowersForGood Wick could've made himself an adored and worthy god had he worked with his brothers for the greater good]]. It's sadly ignored by Wick [[EvilCannotComprehendGood who thinks The Love is soft like his brothers]].
* Wick has the contempt of not just the religious and anti-religious, but all humanity as he considers them nothing more than playthings and planned to start over. But his louder critics are as mentioned those who already hold the idea of a god in contempt and feel validated by the Father of Colors. The Emperor of Mankind considers him more of a Chaos Daemon than anything and while he's not that fond of him due to his militant atheism, he thinks Filt and Unan are right in saying while HumansAreFlawed, [[HumansAreSpecial they have such wondrous potential]]. Wick immediately resorted to pissing him off even further by pointing out [[AGodIAmNot for all his claims]] [[PhysicalGod Big E is closer to a god than a human]] [[{{Hypocrite}} and is as prideful and self-righteous as one]]. [[ShutUpKirk The Emperor decided the Imperial Fist wasn't enough]] [[TheReasonYouSuckSpeech and choice words were needed]].
--> '''Emperor of Mankind''': "So you know the old saying "those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones"? [[HypocrisyNod I may live a glass house]], but ''you'' are throwing asteroids off a glass CityPlanet. [[NecessaryEvil What I do is for humanity to conquer the grim darkness of our galaxy]]. What have you done with your power? [[PsychopathicManchild Nothing but an overgrown child]] [[BadPeopleAbuseAnimals who pull wings off a fly]]; [[InsultToRocks there are ORKS with more imagination than you]]. You show up [[HistoricalRapSheet and do you "vengeful God" BS]] [[{{Sadist}} because it gives you an erection]], and try to hit the reset [[ItsAllAboutMe because you didn't get your glorified foot massage]]. Allow me to give you what your brothers couldn't-[[PreAsskickingOneLiner a real fucking spanking!]]"
* Wick's response to the aforementioned verbal scolding? "[[ComicallyMissingThePoint How can I get an erection?]] [[BarbieDollAnatomy Look at my crotch!]] Though I did participate in an orgy, [[{{Touche}} so maybe you have a point]]". The Emperor just stopped talking to him afterwards, instead siccing Kratos on the Father of Colors. The Ghost of Sparda was so jaded from the [[JerkassGods jerkassery]] of [[Myth/ClassicalMythology two]] [[Myth/NorseMythology pantheons]] the only comment he made mid-roar was "the only thing special about you [[AtLeastIAdmitIt is your]] [[CardCarryingVillain honesty]]". This comment got a thumbs up from Spawn, who plans to send Wick to super-Hell as he's seen [[GodAndSatanAreBothJerks how evil God and the Devil can be]]...and Wick is both entities in one.
* Wick is so evil that one of the only things YHVH and Lucifer agree on [[EvenEvilHasStandards is looking at him with derision]] ''at best''. The Great Will [[BerserkButton takes claims He's a Demiurge rather poorly]] [[DemiurgeArchetype even if it is accurate]] so He likes to project Wick being everything humans who hate him see Him as. To YHVH's shock, Lucifer felt almost the same, [[EvilCounterpart seeing Wick as the worst possible aspects of him given life]]. These comparisons ''might'' have [[InsultBackfire been taken well]] [[CardCarryingVillain by Wick]], but he's pissed that since they're so powerful they can crush him like a bug, he can't get away with trying to snark them out. Still, he is brazen enough to say [[NotSoDifferentRemark YHVH sees humanity as something to only exist for Him, JUST like himself]]. 
* He and Goetia have argued over what should be done with humanity; Goetia believes humanity should be rebooted in a way to become perfect deathless beings, while Wick wants to kill and replace them because he's unimpressed with how they turned out. Dr Weil also argues over what should be done with humanity; that being Wick shouldn't just KillAllHumans but keep them alive [[DystopiaJustifiesTheMeans so he can rule as sovereign]] [[FateWorseThanDeath of a living death]]...unfortunately, Wick decided he had a point even if he felt Weil wasn't funny enough to be a friend. Now the Joker, he's hilarious to the Father of Colors and sees him as one of the few humans be likes, along with the Four Libertines as [[DepravedBisexual their "parties"]] look even more fun than the Hollywood orgy he had. The Joker is fond of Wick in turn because under [[MonsterClown the clown gig]] [[TheMadHatter and self-loving insanity]] [[MisanthropeSupreme he's an absolute misanthrope]], while the the Libertines simply see him as someone to hide under and further their own depravities.
* With every other {{God}} and [[Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei the top-billing]] [[{{Satan}} Lucifer]] disregarding him Wick looked for other [[DemiurgeArchetype Demiurge figures]] to be an ally. He quickly found himself on the wrong side of Homura Akemi as she is ''disgusted'' by his sadism and in turn he is disgusted that a mere human [[DeityOfHumanOrigin became someone stronger than him]]. He wasn't discouraged though and found a Demiurge after his own heart in Zanza. The two agreed that [[ItsAllAboutMe mortals only exist to please themselves and only that]]. The two also shared at annoyance with Archangel Michael and the Valar for "their bleeding hearts interfering in the fun of people like us". This is because the Valar fighting off Melkor's reign of terror and Michael thwarting Lucifer's attempted conquest of Heaven are all too similar to Unan and Flint thwarting and undoing Wick's destructive rampages in Biblical times.
** Despite his issues with Homura he approves of human [[DemiurgeArchetype Demiurge Archetypes]]; Nobuyuki Sugou and Robert Daly. He also thinks they're pathetic, but in a "aw look, they're trying" way, or as his enemies have said "PsychologicalProjection at its finest". He tolerates them being human examples because unlike Homura they're normal people outside of digital reality and thus don't challenge his ego. 
* Wick was also interested to learn of the Phantom Thieves' experience [[HeelFaceBrainwashing changing hearts]] of [[HateSink with the dregs of humanity]], which he mockingly said "and I thought I was evil". As a CardCarryingVillain who hates free will it's entirely [[{{Troll}} to rile them up]]; he thinks they "need to be knocked down a peg" for taking out a rather literal Demiurge in Yaldabaoth, or as [[DeadpanSnarker Wick]] likes to call him "YHVH-lite". [[UnderestimatingBadassery He underestimates them]] [[WrongGenreSavvy because he thinks an actual deity is by default far more powerful]] than one born from the collective unconsciousness; said Thieves simply regard Wick as an abomination that needs to be destroyed. He is also seen as an abomination by Ghaleon since though he once believed humanity needed a god, after being defeated and later revived he came to the conclusion humanity and their bonds make them more than capable of handling themselves, even against the power of another malicious deceiver with godlike power known as Zophar. [[CompleteMonster And Wick? He's worse than any god or devil he's ever seen]].
* To his consternation even those [[SatanicArchetype akin to the Devil]] if not [[{{Satan}} the genuine article]] do not like him, which he considers a disappointment-he may be a god [[CardCarryingVillain but he always related more to the Bible's big bad guy]]. Zamasu and Lucemon may be equivalents to Lucifer, but they're [[{{Hypocrite}} hypocritical]] [[KnightTemplar knight templars]] who consider Wick a disgrace of a deity that would prevent [[NotSoWellIntentionedExtremist their alleged utopia]] from coming to be. Or as [[DeadpanSnarker Wick]] puts it, "they hate me because they're politicians". The ''Castlevania'' Satan is more agreeable, but he scoffs at the idea of working with the Father of Colors because he only seems him as a pawn to cruel back to Heaven and get revenge on {{God}}. As far as the [[BrightIsNotGood colorful deity]] is concerned, Satan has daddy issues and probably sees some of the man upstairs in him, something he was upset over; he wanted to have fun causing chaos with the guy.
* Despite all this, some devils gave Wick a thumbs up. The Beast explained he inspired the Devil across the universe, as Wick inspired the vengeful God on his version of Earth. And as such, he takes pride of spreading his wicked influence in the hearts of men and he agrees with Wick that humans are playthings at best, so he gets along with the Father of Colors. HIM also gets along with "my fellow flamboyant fiend!" [[ForTheEvulz because evil is just that fun]]. As he felt ignored by the Satan of ''South Park'' since [[AscendedDemon he went to Heaven]] he chose to get back at him by telling him that [[EasyRoadToHell his Hell has all but a handful of deceased souls]]. It's AHellOfATime, and Wick would like to correct this. Having believed the afterlife was made up by Biblical writers, Wick is worryingly intrigued by an actual {{Hell}} and has come to a) screw with ''South Park'' Satan [[TheDevilIsALoser just because he's an easy target]] and b) go visit Dis and talk ways to grind humanity under their heel. The Emperor of the Kingdom Dolorous was all too eager to help as seeing [[GodIsEvil such perversion of his creator]] on the same wavelength as him tickles him pink.
* He and [[Series/{{Supernatural}} the Lucifer]] who is the son of Chuck are good friends, [[VitriolicBestBuds though they tend to argue]]. Wick, like him, is [[PsychopathicManchild a childish psychopath]] who loves to lord over others, have an estranged relationship with saner siblings[[note]]though unlike the other archangels Unan and Flint are unambiguously heroic[[/note]] and a notable disappointment with humanity...however they differ in that Lucifer is envious of humans and thinks HumansAreBastards, but Wick doesn't think they're bastardly enough. In short, [[AtLeastIAdmitIt He critiques Lucifer for not being honest]], but likes working with him. [[spoiler:He is straight-up friends with [[GodIsEvil his dad]] after learning He created the Supernatural universe to amuse himself and went on an apocalyptic tirade when Sam and Dean didn't follow the script.]]
* Colorful yet deadly [[EvilIsHammy and over the top]], Wick was amused by Ragyo Kiryuin [[BrightIsNotGood rocking the vibrant colors while]] [[TranshumanTreachery she sells her former species out]]. She couldn't care what he thinks, though they did agree that "Blumenkranz" slaps. He was also intrigued by the Colour out Of Space [[FictionalColour as something familiar...yet very different]]. If said Colour can even ''communicate'' with Wick, much less want to reply, no-one knows. He was also intrigued by Rick as someone known for careless debauchery and chaos [[InsufferableGenius due to his genius]]. He met Rick, reached his hand to him...only to fall through a portal trap and landing in a universe devoid of color. Angrily bursting out [[ItOnlyWorksOnce since that was already tried on him]], he demanded an answer why. He didn't get it, but anyone who really knows Rick that he may think he's AboveGoodAndEvil, [[EvenEvilHasStandards but there's some cruelty even he can't stomach]] [[Recap/RickAndMortyS2E9LookWhosPurging like serious "purging"]] or [[Recap/RickAndMortyS2E9LookWhosPurging fascist timelines]].
* He is also seen as low by more grey-morality [[RealityWarper reality warpers]] like Discord and Q. The former admittedly [[HeelFaceTurn is a different man]] from the spirit of chaos and disharmony he used to be, but even back then [[LaughablyEvil he had a sense of whimsy]] [[EvenEvilHasStandards and didn't turn ponies to stone]]. As he puts it, his rampant destruction lacks any flair and even the whole [[GodIsEvil Biblical twist]] to his actions is kind of cliche. The latter likes using his higher Overdeity status to humiliate Wick and remind him that he's not ''that'' high on the pantheonic totem pole. [[ItsAllAboutMe Given his narcissism]], Wick takes the most offense to Q's trolling and would've preferred the both of them use their powers [[{{Understatement}} more mischievously]]. 
* Though content with [[DemiurgeArchetype the trope he has]], Wick feels that BrightIsNotGood might have been a better choice. However he doesn't hold any hard feelings towards Tamatoa taking the trope before he showed up, since he finds Tamatoa to be an entertaining crustacean. Wick's interest in the colorful is because in his universe he created the human concept of colors and can travel through them; it's why he claims he should lead the House of Pantheon/{{Colours}}, despite their protests. In response to those protests Wick decided to throw a party for his friends and not invite anyone in the House of Colours except for Tamatoa, instead of his usual violent rampages. When some brave soul asked why [[PokeThePoodle he was scaling back his wrath]], Wick replied "[[VillainsOutShopping I just felt like throwing a party]], did you think I couldn't scale back my wrath? Hopeless". To his credit Wick can playing along and entertainment the crowds, [[EvilIsHammy with some mistaking him for an actor or performance artist]], [[FauxAffablyEvil but he's so fickle it rarely lasts]].
* He's also amused by the Chaos Gods because, asides from [[{{Understatement}} pissing off]] [[NayTheist nay-theists]] like the Emperor of Mankind they follow the ethos that [[JerkassGods a deity can do whatever the hell they want to mortals]], and the chaos they bring is hilarious to a sadistic hedonist like himself. They don't see him as all that important though, [[{{Narcissist}} which is his one real issue with them]]. He did get a friend from the C'Tan, though; Meph'etran the Deceiver showed up to say he's a fan of his work and would like to have some fun with him. However, he's also advised the Father of Colors on how he should do more long-term planning if he really wants to have fun. 
* While Wick is just as warped as the Batman Who Laughs and Kefka, he does walk on eggshells around them. Not that he doesn't have a problem with their depths of AxCrazy chaos; far from it [[ArsonMurderAndAdmiration as he's amazed what they have achieved despite being human]]. It's that the two have a nasty habit of taking god-like power for themselves. The insane Bruce Wayne isn't shy how he'd turn on Wick; [[KarmicTransformation forcibly turn him into a mortal human]], blind him and [[FateWorseThanDeath have fun with him]], but he likes Wick's style and wants to keep him around. Him and Kefka are in agreement that Wick needs to up his game, but otherwise they're cool with him [[HorrifyingTheHorror even if they want to rattle him]]. Wick is less argumentative with Bill Cipher since he's more interested in fucking with humans than fellow god-beings...and he appreciates Wick's humor more. While Bill's appearance gives Wick some bad memories reminding him of the pyramid that imprisoned him
* Wick detests the SCP Foundation because they exist in part to contain hostile anomalies like himself and they have managed to contain more dangerous beings than him. Out of spite Wick aided SCP-106 in a containment breach and out of sadism [[PassThePopcorn brought some chardonnay for his rampage]]. The more well-read sadist SCP-035 took the opportunity to break out, appease Wick's malicious curiosity...to try him on for a laugh, [[BlatantLies as surely someone as powerful as him is immune to his effects]]. Scarily the ego play worked and 035-Wick went on a rampage until some of the pantheon's Overdeities manhandled the combo and ripped off the mask. Wick's divine biology allowed both his mind and face to survive the experience, [[AndIMustScream but he had no control of his body wearing the mask]] and is deeply disturbed by the whole affair. He's still afraid of the mask.
* Though he doesn't fear the Saint of Killers as much as the anomalous mask, he does sweat in his general direction because his guns can kill ''anything'' that's not undead [[CosmicEntity or so far beyond him as to not recognize him]]. For all his power Wick is neither, but he is [[GodIsEvil the same type of god]] that screwed the Saint over in the first place...so his concern is understandable. On the brighter side[[note]]for him and him alone[[/note]], despite how things went [[EvilIsNotAToy when he tangled with]] [=SCPs=] [[EvilHasABadSenseOfHumor he did get a good laugh]] out of the Yule Man. When asked why, he said "he's [[SantaClaus a normally friendly idea]] [[BadSanta made sick]] [[{{Santabomination}} and twisted!]] [[GodIsEvil I can so relate!]] Think I'll do my own take on Easter".
* Has no idea why Kthanid for all of his immense power [[DidWeJustHaveTeaWithCthulhu likes humans]] and why he has such a problem with him screwing with them. Kthanid replied "don't expect to get along with [[EldritchAbomination my kind]] [[WhiteSheep even if I'm the gentle giant of the group]]". Turns out he's right as his brother [[Pantheon/OthernessAbominations Cthulhu]] has said in [[BlackSpeech R'ylehian]] "he (Wick) embarrasses himself". Most of the Pantheon/CthulhuMythos [[AboveGoodAndEvil may be mostly indifferent to Wick and his brothers]], but they [[EvilIsPetty Wick is really petty]]; even [[BrightIsNotGood Has]][[HumanoidAbomination tur]] derided Wick as "useless". The two big exceptions to this are the Defiler and the Crawling Chaos, who think what he does is amusing. The Father of Colors agrees.

* Enemies: The [[Pantheon/StarWars Sith]] (especially '''[[Pantheon/TyrannicalFigures Sheev]] [[Pantheon/{{Depravity}} Palpatine]]''' and '''[[Pantheon/GoodAndEvilColors Darth Maul]]'''), [[Pantheon/MilitaryRanks General Grievous]], [[Pantheon/{{Reclusiveness}} Ra's Al Ghul]], [[Pantheon/OtherDimensions Barbatos]] and [[Pantheon/VillainousCounterparts his Dark Knights]], [[Pantheon/Warhammer40000 The Chaos Gods]], [[Pantheon/MotivationsForEvil Cletus Kasady/Carnage]], [[Pantheon/MedicalConditions The Grineer]]
* Special Relationships: [[Pantheon/ActsOfWar Count Dooku]] (former master), [[Pantheon/IntellectualArchetypes Obi-Wan Kenobi]] (former apprentice), the [[Pantheon/FamilyDynamics entire]] [[Pantheon/{{Monarchs}} Sky]][[Pantheon/EnergyWeaponry walker ]] [[Pantheon/{{Siblings}} family]]
* Respects: Any and all who can [[BalanceBetweenGoodAndEvil Balance the Light and Dark]] within themselves
* Born on Coruscant, Qui-Gon Jinn was the apprentice of Count Dooku, the master of Obi-Wan Kenobi, and [[TheChooserOfTheOne the one who found]] [[TheChosenOne Anakin Skywalker]]. Qui-Gon Jinn is a master of [[CombatParkour Form IV: Ataru]], a Jedi who follows TheForce above all else, and someone who many believe to be the ''true'' master of Anakin. For [[Webcomic/DarthsAndDroids some reason]] there's a rumor going around that he has the ability to SummonBiggerFish whenever he calls it. He isn't very sure what to think about it.
** Qui-Gon is one of the only Jedi of his time to understand what ''true'' [[BalanceBetweenGoodAndEvil balance]] in TheForce actually is. Understanding that it isn't what most Sith ''or'' Jedi believe it to be. This belief not only makes him a bit of a [[ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight maverick]] in the Order, but labels him to what others would call a "Grey Jedi". Ironically his belief to follow the Force above the Republic makes him one of the only ''true'' Jedi of his time. Something both Darth Sidious and Darth Plagueis are very much aware of.
* Among the Jedi, Qui-Gon is a very well respected member of the order, to the point where he was even offered the chance [[Literature/StarWarsMasterAndApprentice to join the Jedi Council]]. To which he obviously refused, believing that if he joined he would miss something [[Film/ThePhantomMenace important]].
** He was also happy to see his former apprentice Obi-Wan in Pantheon. The two saw each other when their home galaxy when Qui-Gon (and eventually Obi-Wan too) was a Force-Ghost. The two are glad to be able to see one another in the flesh now. He's also happy to see his former master Dooku leave the side of the Sith. While he has yet to fully redeem himself, Qui-Gon believes that it will happen in due time. He ''wasn't'' however very thrilled to see Grievous, the notorious Jedi killer of the Clone Wars.
* It should go without saying, but Qui-Gon has a strong connection to the Skywalker Family. Anakin views Qui-Gon as the [[ParentalSubstitute father he never had]], and the Skywalker sibling view his a grandfather of sorts. Padmé was genuinely happy to see him again, but was greatly annoyed when he realized that he saw through her disguise as a handmaid and essentially {{troll}}ed her throughout their journey together. Luke himself considers him a member of the Skywalker family.
* Like most Jedi, Qui-Gon hates Palpatine, as in ''really'' hates Palpatine. It was Palpatine that corrupted both his master (Count Dooku) and apprentice (Anakin Skywalker). It was Palpatine who destroyed the Jedi and brought imbalance to the Force. It was Palpatine who instructed Maul to insure that Qui-Gon died on Naboo. Obviously Qui-Gon's hatred for Palpatine is on a [[ItsPersonal personal level]].
** There's an actual reason why Palpatine made sure Maul killed him on Naboo. That reason being that had Qui-Gon lived, everything that happened in that galaxy after his death would have never come to past. Neither Anakin or Dooku would have fallen to TheDarkSide and betrayed the Jedi Order. The Clone Wars may never have happened and with it Order 66. Palpatine actually feared that Qui-Gon could have potentially learned of his true identity as Darth Sidious. Qui-Gon was the greatest, and in some ways the ''only'', obstacle in Palpatine's plan for galactic dominance.
** As he was the one who killed him, he has a strong sense of animosity towards Maul, but at the same time he greatly pities him. Knowing that Maul had a very difficult life filled tragedy, pain and hate. Maul, to the surprise of many, was actually ''glad'' to see Qui-Gon again. The first thing Maul did was to actually ''thank'' him for what Qui-Gon had done for him. To elaborate, Maul had initially believed his skills to be [[so ArrogantKungFuGuy great]] that he could have taken on the ''entire'' Jedi Council by himself. Actually fighting a Jedi Master that, to his own admission, nearly defeated him greatly toned down his ego. Maul isn't blind on how Qui-Gon was in at a disadvantage during their fight. Not only had age weakened and slowed him down, but his main fighting style specialized the use of wide open spaces and ending the battle as fast as possible. With Maul not only prolonging the fight and being in a confined space, Qui-Gon lost is advantage and in turn, was placed at a disadvantage. One that would cost him his life.
* Qui-Gon greatly appreciates Venom/Eddie Brock for finally convincing his former master in leaving Palpatine's side. Because of his actions, he's greatly supportive of Eddie and approves of his attempts of being a better man. He also treats both Flash Thompson and the Venom Symbiote itself with great respect. [[spoiler:But he admittedly worried about the existence of Knull and the true origins of the Klyntars. He hopes that both Eddie and the current Jedi Order have the strength to stop him, should he ascend into Pantheon]].
** He has nothing but contempt for Cletus Kasady and the Carnage symbiote. Both Cletus and the Carnage Symbiote ''chose'' to be the [[CompleteMonster monsters]] that they are.
* Like other Jedi members, Qui-Gon would form a partnership/friendship with a member of the Lantern Corps, specifically with one named Abin Sur. The two took an immediate liking to one another and have gone on a number of missions to protect the galaxy. The two would sometimes talk about their lives and involvement in the prophecies concerning both their orders, the Ancient Jedi Prophecy, and the Prophecy of the ComicBook/BlackestNight. The two also bonded on how someone close to them turned evil, Dooku for Qui-Gon and Sinestro for Abin Sur.
* He's one of the few Force users aware of the secrets of becoming a Force-Ghost. The art of maintaining ones consciousness after [[AscendedToAHigherPlaneOfExistence becoming one with the Force]]. Although Qui-Gon never managed to complete his training in the physical world, so it's difficult for him to form a visible form without being in an area with strong ties to the Force. It was Qui-Gon himself, as a spirit, who trained Yoda who would later then train Obi-Wan and then finally Luke in this art. He is currently teaching other Jedi members the same, because while DeathIsCheap in Pantheon it isn't [[DeathIsASlapOnTheWrist a slap on the wrist]]. So it takes time for them to come back, time that can still be used to help their friends and allies.
* [[Creator/LiamNeeson For some]] [[Film/BatmanBegins reason]] Qui-Gon was once attacked by members of the Bat-Family. It wasn't until Qui-Gon drew his lightsaber and Force Lifted Damian (much to his annoyance) did they realize they made a mistake. After a bit of explaining/apologizing, Qui-Gon learned of Ra's al Ghul, The Demon's Head, and Damian's grandfather. The incident made Qui-Gon and Ra's al Ghul bitter enemies, as well as making him (and by extension the Jedi) allies to the Bat-Family.
** It was from Batman when Qui-Gon learned of Barbatos and his Dark Knights. Qui-Gon had made it his (and the Jedi Order's) mission to destroy them.
* Qui-Gon is nothing short of disgusted with the existence of the Chaos Gods. He sees them as massive aberrations in the Force, and has made efforts into learning how to eliminate them for good. While they don't see him as much of a threat, they are annoyed on how he's managed to interfere with a number of their attempts to [[TheCorruption corrupt others]]. To combat the threat of Chaos, Qui-Gon had decided to fight alongside the [[Pantheon/ValuesAndEthics Emperor of Mankind]] and his Imperium. But just like [[Pantheon/{{Cultures}} Mace]] [[Pantheon/AuthorityFigures Windu]], he feels that the Imperium is far too brutal.
* Baring a nasty encounter with the Grineer, Qui-Gon doesn't really have much of a negative opinion on clones. This is mostly because he died long before he could actually [[Film/AttackOfTheClones meet]] any of them, or later be [[Film/RevengeOfTheSith betrayed]] by them. Unlike other Jedi members, Qui-Gon actually has a good relationship with The 501st. In all fairness it might have something to do with their master being Darth Vader, Anakik Skywalker.
* As one who strives to find "Balance in the Force", Qui-Gon has the highest of respect for those who found said "Balance". Some like [[Pantheon/GameDesign Cecil Harvey]], [[Pantheon/OpposingFate Riku]] and most recently [[Pantheon/ValuesAndEthics the Silver Surfer Norrin Radd]].
* Can also be found in the House of Pantheon/PhysicalAppearance.

* Tassadar left the mortal plane during the battle against the Overmind in Aiur. In turn, his sacrifice ushered peace between Templars and Dark Templars amongst Protoss and ensured the survival of Protoss. He is then honored with the phrase 'En Taro Tassadar' and seemingly [[spoiler:turned into a spirit]]. In truth, he was in fact ascended to the Trope Pantheons, where the Pantheon recognized his great sacrifice and compassion. It just took him kinda long to appear in public due to… difficulties.
** While Tassadar was taking his time to show up in the Pantheon, he personally requested for Cosmos to take care of his divine duties and grant blessings to his followers while he was taking care of said difficulties. Once he got everything over with, Cosmos gave Tassadar the title that he was meant to ascend for. In return, Tassadar shows gratitude to Cosmos for helping his followers out while asking little in return.
* Following his ascension, Tassadar was reunited with Zeratul and Jim Raynor. [[spoiler:However, when questioned on the conversations his spirit form apparently had with Zeratul at one point, he was confused, holding no memory of that. Investigation by the two ascended Protoss soon uncovered the truth: the "Tassadar" who had given Zeratul prophetic information and guidance had in fact been the avatar (chosen as [[AFormYouAreComfortableWith a face Zeratul would trust]]) of Ouros, last of the [[BenevolentPrecursors benevolent]] Xel'Naga]].
** He is, in turn, immensely proud of Artanis for finally uniting the Protoss and forever ridding them of the shadow of evil that loomed over them.
* [[VideoGame/HeroesOfTheStorm Fights alongside Zeratul and his other allies in the Nexus]].
* Yes, he can channel the Khala and Void together once more to replicate the attack he did on the Overmind. However, since it killed him last time he did that, he's not exactly willing to do that again unless the situation is dire. Thankfully, DeathIsCheap within the pantheon.
* Seeing and hearing of the Tyranids brings back too many bad memories of the Zerg. Tassadar has offered to help out should the Tyranids ever manage to break the seal.
* '''''En Taro Tassadar!'''''... is what his followers and friends would say. For [[HumbleHero Tassadar himself]], it's always '''''En Taro Adun!'''''
* Also has a spot in the House of [[Pantheon/PeopleOfFaith Faith]].

* Opposes: [[Pantheon/FieldsOfScience Cave Johnson]]
* Bigweld is the founder and original head of Bigweld Industries, the largest and most influential corporation in Robot City. A visionary and big dreamer, his company sells robotic gadgets and spare parts. His two catchphrases are "see a need, fill a need" and "you can shine no matter what you're made of". Unfortunately his company was taken over by a greedy executive who only cares about money, but Bigweld managed to get back in the game.
* While it's a different industry, Bigweld's personality, TV presence and ambitions [[MrAltDisney were molded from Walt Disney]]. Naturally they get along because of their similar personalities. He also gets along with Disney characters Lewis Anthonio, and Phineas and Ferb. Mainly because they are optimistic inventors and go-getters.
* Doesn't take any accusation that Walt Disney is an anti-Semite well, in part because [[Creator/MelBrooks his voice actor is Jewish]]. Sometimes he can be found conversing with Stan Lee, due to being a CoolOldGuy that helped to pioneer and industry. He also likes Willy Wonka for the passion he has in his job and his ambition at making the candy industry a great place.
* The world he comes from doesn't seem to have any humans, leading to some wondering what happened or even if there were any. Mainly the GUAM seeing potential in such a world. Bigweld doesn't like a lot of the members even if he is a robot, but believes he can serve as a reformer and MoralityPet to make the cause of robot power a positive one. For this, he works with Roboking to give a moral core to the GUAM.
* Completely agrees with Optimus Prime that freedom is the right of every sentient being. It doesn't matter if you're an old or new robot, organic, metallic or whatever, it's up to you to decide your own destiny. For this, he hates SKYNET for both committing genocide on organic beings and enslaving robot kind and preventing them from thinking too much.
* Works closely with Dr. Light due to his benevolent visions for robots, and being an expert inventor who thinks of the best of humanity due to his pacifistic nature. He is saddened that his EvilFormerFriend, [[Pantheon/TechnologicalExperts Dr. Wily]], won't put his grudges aside and try to atone. Out of the Mega Man villain, he takes the most umbrage with Lumine, as the Maverick's belief that old robots should be scrapped for the new model is antithetical to Bigweld's own beliefs.
* Was disgusted by how Ghetsis Harmonia exploited the dreams of N, [[AbusiveParents his own foster son]], to achieve his own ambitions of conquering Unova. He is trying to encourage N to achieve his own dreams and be free of any control. Also, while he doesn't hate Cave Johnson, he dislikes his amoral ForScience attitude.
* No fan of grubby corporate bigwigs either. He naturally opposes the likes of Mr. Burns, Looten Plunder and Morris. However it's Mom he takes the most offense with, due to having a massive monopoly over robot kind and the fact she has nothing against terminating overclocked robots so they don't learn to do it to themselves and prevent needing her upgrades, or terminating defective models to preserve her image and brand name.
* Admires Charlie Bucket, due to his good heart and RagsToRiches story. He seems fond of fellow inventor Mei Hatsume, and completely agrees with Emmet Brickowski's optimistic look on the world. As a rule, Bigweld generally gets along with various benevolent robots in the pantheon. 
* Intrigued by the {{Robosexual}} relationship between [[Pantheon/AIPersonalities Kosmo and Nova]]. Likes WALL-E and EVE's relationship as well, but is concerned by the fact the world they lived in was ruined by rampant consumerism and pollution for centuries, until humanity managed to come back and restore life to it. This has made Bigweld more environmentally conscious.
* While he likes Alisa Bosconovitch for being a kind-hearted android who does what she is purposed to do, he doesn't like the fact she is serving [[Pantheon/SplitPersonalities Jin Kazama]] for committing mass genocide, even if he does it for a reason like awakening Azazel and to hopefully destroy him to erase his Devil Gene that lurks around him.

* Enemies: People who treat their subordinates horribly, [[Pantheon/DigitalPersonas the Master Control Program]], [[Pantheon/{{Gameplay}} Sark]], [[Pantheon/{{Goals}} Clu]], [[Pantheon/{{Food}} Gluttony]]
* Estonia always finds himself in ''very'' odd situations. First the [[GenderFlip Nyotalia]], then the Mochis... Finding himself in the Pantheon was one of them. It warranted his ascension since it was noted that he is on those situations due to his AuthorAvatar status.
** He is grateful that Mordecai and Rigby have invited him [[INeedAFreakingDrink to eat buffalo wings]] after hearing about that.
** Though he has eventually embraced it. Finding Estonia riding the Mochi version of America around the Pantheon is not an uncommon sight.
* A few are wondering if he actually is the creator of Axis Powers Hetalia, and is using the name Hidekaz Himayura as an alias. He hasn't commented on this.
* Is on relatively good terms with most of the other deities from his home universe, despite not interacting with them all that much. 
* Spends most of his time in the House of Technology, due to his enjoyment of computer programming and hacking. He's occasionally joined by Radical Ed in this, and the two get along. She then introduced him to Otacon, and the two get along well too.
** Joining the group does have its flaws, as doing a hack risks the five being drawn into Space Paranoids by the Master Control Program and getting locked up inside a pit cell. Quite fortunate that Sora sometimes visits the computer worlds and is friends with the original trio. More fortunate that the pit cell are still being repaired after [[Pantheon/OffensivePowers Murray Hippo]] tricked the MCP into zapping him just so that he could wreck the cell and Sark.
* Surprisingly, he's a good singer. Most of the House of Music is impressed by that time he was able to conduct a revolution solely through signing.... which is one of the few things from that period of his life that he's willing to talk about. 
* Occasionally visits his brother in the House of Emotion. He finds that it depresses him.... 
* Looks up to the Author, seeing how he was [[TropeCodifier partially inspired by him]]. The Author is happy to see that one of his followers [[Administrivia/TropesAreTools didn't end up as bad as he thought]].
* Once met a [[GenderFlip girl version]] of Myth/KingArthur sometime after he ascended. He dismissed it as a dream at first due to what happened with the Nyotalia girls, but it turns out that there ''is'' a girl King Arthur, to his surprise.
* Yu Narukami is good friends with Estonia since he is also a really kind brother, often worrying about Latvia and helping them with money.
* To say he is utterly terrified of Gluttony would be an {{Understatement}}. As if the fact that the homunculus [[Creator/YasuhiroTakato sounds like Russia]] wasn't bad enough, Gluttony once tried to eat him. With no real malice about it of course, but that reminded him even more of Russia.

* Was called to the Pantheon and at first was ashamed because he [[spoiler:thought they were catching him for forging approval papers]]. Instead, the powers that be admitted that he fit AudienceSurrogate pretty well and, after the resulting fight in Forever Fall, gave him a Demigod standing. Ruby Rose hugged him in delight.
** When he ascended, he had to ride a special jet plane that left him a little...airsick. The first thing he did before his meeting with the Council was vomit in a nearby trashcan. The Trollkaiger loves to laugh at his nickname, "Vomit Boy". Jaune takes it in stride as, in his opinion, it's better than being stuffed into rocket lockers.
* Trains super-hard with the likes of Link to improve his skill with the sword and shield. He also hopes to work with Lucario to help unlock more of his powers of Aura. This was so that when his fellow teammates make it to the Pantheon, he would be able to fight alongside them. Team RWBY has also been willing to train him.
* Tries his best to impress many of the goddesses in the House of Love, but usually falls flat on his face doing so. It did not really help that most of them really were wondering how oblivious he was to Pyrrha's affection forwards him (though he got better).
* Was seen in a long period of mourning, along with the rest of people of his world, for [[Creator/MontyOum a great man]] who will be [[DiedDuringProduction sorely missed]]. Ever since [[Pantheon/{{Workmanship}} the man ascended]], Jaune likes to visit his shrine.
* Upon the ascension of Jeanne d'Arc, his namesake, he sought her out of curiosity. She was impressed by his dedication to being a hero despite his lack of formal training and has begun teaching him both swordcraft and leadership skills.
** Has also been continuing his training under Link when he has the time; already, the Hero of Courage has managed to teach Jaune a few of his specials, such as the Spin Attack (optionally enhanced by Aura) and the Helm-Splitter, and is working on teaching him the powerful Mortal Draw attack.
* Jaune will always hold up to a promise he makes to his friends. At one point, he even [[spoiler:wore a dress to a dance to keep his promise to Pyrrha]]. The rest of the Pantheon laughed at that, but Jaune didn't care about that.
* Might have some distant Hispanic cousin called Juane in Mexico. [[Blog/RWBYRecaps Who might not even know]] [[GratuitousSpanish how to speak proper Spanish]].
* Is quite afraid of Felix, who in addition to being quite a two-faced bastard, has a voice that sounds eerily similar to Jaune's own. At least the Reds and Blues made sure to have his back for whatever problems Felix might present.
* [[spoiler:While not really gone, he, Nora, Ren and Ruby have gone for a journey, with him saying that they don't know when they will return. As in regards to Pyrrha, Jaune really hasn't brought himself to visit her shrine after hearing about her ultimate fate against Cinder. Still, he carries a recording of one of her lessons in his scroll and wears a Pumpkin Pete's sweater under his armor to always remember her by.]]
** He's also been good support for [[Pantheon/FriendsAndCompanions Kairi]] after [[spoiler:she lost [[Pantheon/GamingGenresNToZ Sora]] in the aftermath of the Second Keyblade War. He knows what it's like to lose someone you cared deeply for, and hopes Pyrrha will look after Sora until Neku finds them]].
* He has been joined on his journey by Ruby’s uncle [[Pantheon/{{Misfortune}} Qrow Branwen]]. Initially, he was skeptical due to Qrow's distance and aloof personality. As he began to explain himself and [[TheJinx his Semblance]], Jaune has begun to follow in his footsteps. He still isn’t quite okay with Qrow's [[TheAlcoholic drinking habits]], though.

* President Business. Or as a supervillain, Lord Business. The eccentric and ultra-rich mogul of his town with a curious hairpiece, he's a popular and powerful businessman who essentially runs the place. Unfortunately he's also a supervillain, who uses relics from a higher plane ([[spoiler:actually human tools]]) to assert his authority. His goal was to use the Kragle to glue and freeze everyone in place, in order to achieve perfect order, all driven by his desire to be special and live up to expectations. Ultimately Emmett Brickowski would convince him otherwise, and after a pep talk he ended his villainous ways. [[spoiler:He and Emmett are modeled after a man and his son competing over how to play with LEGO.]]
* Was once an ideal candidate for the GUAL, but he would rather just ignore them now. YHVH is most displeased he would redeem himself under ThePowerOfFriendship, as he desired a perfectly ordered world. Darkseid used to think he was ideal, [[BewareTheSillyOnes as despite his silliness]] [[VileVillainSaccharineShow he was a ruthless antagonist]]. He is massively disappointed that he could give up on evil like that. Though given he's ultimately a LEGO minifigure, Business isn't that much of a loss.
* Other gods disappointed at his HeelFaceTurn are Yaldabaoth/YHVH, Malthael and Clu. The first because he thought Business' vision would ensure total societal order([[DystopiaJustifiesTheMeans admittedly by freezing everyone in place]]), the second as it would end free will as a problem, and the third because he sought true perfection and the are both ThePerfectionist. Cyrus used to be an ally, but they are decent terms given [[Manga/PokemonDiamondAndPearlAdventure recently he's been having second thoughts on]] [[WorldOfSilence a "perfect world"]].
* Lord Business may not want a world of perfect order, but he'd much prefer society to retain law and order. His heart isn't in it to oppose Lucifer and the Pantheon/GrandUnitedAllianceOfChaos, but he has a lot of distaste for the champion of chaos. [[GoKartingWithBowser If he wants to join him in a game of golf, he's still cool with that]]. Now he tends to chill and continue his corporation. Also, Taco Tuesday is still a must.
* If you can't tell, Lord Business is a homage to the iconic yet controversial New York businessman and 45th US President, UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump. The odd hairpiece, the eccentric corporate mogul personality, the political ambitions and power over the city are classic Trump. Not the only example in the pantheon, which has affected his interactions
** Biff Tannen took Trump-like qualities in the BadFuture, but Business doesn't think much of him. Well, the BadFuture version. He finds it a bit upsetting that unlike him, Old Biff remained resentful even if he stopped being an aggressive bully. Though [[AttemptedRape given his attack on Lorraine]], he supposes this is LaserGuidedKarma. However [[EvenEvilHasStandards both]] [[EveryoneHasStandards of them]] consider Donald Love to be a homicidal maniac, [[CompleteMonster and for good reason]].
** Thomas Wayne took on Trump traits in [[Film/Joker2019 the Joker's origin film]]. Well OK, [[MultipleChoicePast one origin]]. [[AdaptationalJerkass The prime Thomas is more scrupulous]], but the now reformed Buisness sometimes hangs out with him about their experiences and achievements. Elsewhere in the DC Universe, Lex Luthor has been taking notes from the New York businessman when he embraced the CorruptCorporateExecutive role, and considers Business a rival. He tried being a better person like Business, [[ChronicVillainy but ultimately fell back to his supervillain role]].
* Given the seriousness of his villainy, the Phantom Thieves of Heart arrived in the belief that they'd have another [[CorruptPolitician Masayoshi Shido]] on their hand. Unlike [[{{Narcissist}} Shi]][[TheSociopath do]], though, Business was capable of seeing the error of his ways on his own accord and is now just a general, if influential businessman, so they ultimately left him alone. However he had some pity for Goro Akechi despite everything because of how [[AbusiveParents he was treated by Shido]]. It reminds Business of how his parents never validated or encouraged him, [[FreudianExcuse which is what fueled his villainy in the first place]].
* Him and Eliphas were once much more order-oriented, but have mellowed out; Business more so. Sometimes they talk about it and how they were changed. Interestingly Lord Business [[CardCarryingVillain was aware he was evil]], but also a KnightTemplar. Business is also on good terms with Philip Price given their corporate leanings, [[spoiler:and the latter's own redemption. This is due to finding a common enemy with [[Pantheon/{{Despondency}} Elliot Alderson]], who's neutral on Business if anyone's asking]].
* Another businessman he's on good terms with is Speedwagon, though it's not a serious friendship. An optimistic and kind-hearted hero changed him as well, though he was never as bad as Lord Business. He's more of an ally with Mr Krabs. President Business has also been seen competing in the financial field with Seto Kaiba, who's drive to prove himself is something Business can relate to somewhat.
* Ex-villains President Business gets along with are White Diamond and Starlight Glimmer. As they were driven to evil out of a misguided perfectionism, he understands where they're coming from. He's pretty chill with ex-villain Megamind, perhaps out of their shared desire for a place in life. Or maybe it's because they're both voiced by Creator/WillFerrell.
* As a villain, his plan of freezing people in place is rather similar to Tabuu turning people into trophies. [[SilentAntagonist Tabuu's not chatty]], but some like to say Business plagiarized him. The lord of Subspace was confused as to why, if he's no longer a villain, why he still enjoys wearing the costume. His response? [[EvilIsCool "Hey, it's cool!"]]

* Steve Zissou is an oceanographer and documentary filmmaker who has chronicled his various adventures in looking at sea-life with his team. When one of his crewmates gets killed by a jaguar shark during one of those films, Zissou decides to make his next project focused on killing that animal in revenge. He is a bit full of himself when it comes to making sure things work out, but in the midst of several events going on during production such as meeting Ned Plimpton, who claimed to be Zissou’s long-lost son (later turned out not to be the case) and encountering a group of hijackers, the journey is also sort of a self-reflection on Zissou and his character. In the end, Zissou and his team encountered the jaguar shark underwater, but Zissou ultimately abandoned his goal of revenge (revenge wasn’t worth it, the shark looked beautiful, and Zissou was out of dynamite anyways) and dedicated that film to Ned.
* During production on another film of his, Zissou heard rumors of an ocean far away that was home to several mysterious sea creatures that few, if any, have ever seen. He decided to make this mysterious ocean the focus of an upcoming project and after enough time, he and the rest of his team prepared themselves for a journey much farther from home than they were used to. The journey lasted for a couple of months and upon encountering some unusual fish and other forms of aquatic life they hadn’t seen before, Team Zissou resurfaced from the water and discovered a town that was new to them. They were greeted by a civilian and from there, Zissou and the others discovered that they were in a place known as “Pantheon”, which was home to several unusual things they’ve never heard of before. It took a bit of time for Zissou to process what was going on, especially after learning that some in the Pantheon are aware of his exploits, but he took it in stride and accepted having a part in that place.
* It didn’t take long for David Attenborough, an important figure when it comes to making documentaries about nature, to have some interest in another individual who specializes in making films about wildlife, specifically those tied to oceans. Attenborough did have some concerns about Zissou, mainly regarding the latter’s at-times arrogant attitude and the fact that he attempted to kill a jaguar shark during filming. Those doubts dissipated over time since Zissou wasn’t a bad person regardless and he ultimately didn’t kill that animal in the end. Attenborough has already done documentaries on marine life and has expressed interest in collaborating with Zissou on one, with the oceanographer being open to that idea.
* There is a notable contrast between him and Captain Ahab as far as the “revenge against an animal” aspect of their tales are concerned. Both went on seafaring adventures to find an animal, but the two of them are different from each other in many ways. Zissou is a bit arrogant at times, but ultimately isn’t a bad person at heart whereas Ahab presents himself as a respected adventurer, but is so caught up in his revenge that he put his crewmates at risk. Zissou also gave up on revenge for a few reasons, but Ahab continued his vengeful trek which presumably came at the cost of his own life. Zissou isn’t really that interested in meeting with Ahab, but the captain hasn’t taken Zissou that seriously given how the oceanographer didn’t follow through with his revenge compared to Ahab.
* Another ocean adventurer that Zissou got to know about was Captain Nemo, who commandeered a submarine and, like Ahab, had morally dubious ambitions involving revenge that proved to be dangerous for those involved with him. Captain Nemo is also very familiar with marine biology and learning that there was someone who made movies about marine life prompted him to meet up with Zissou. The captain was initially annoyed that Zissou attempted to kill a kind of marine life for revenge, but after finding out that Zissou let go of his vendetta, he was willing to let Zissou be a part of his adventures. Even if Zissou was willing to give Captain Nemo more of a benefit of the doubt compared to Ahab given Nemo’s interest in sea life, the risks involved (especially regarding Nemo’s true goal) resulted in Zissou backing out of that arrangement, much to Nemo’s disappointment.
* The ABZU Diver was someone who cared greatly about ocean life and was willing to meet with Zissou after learning that he was a dedicated oceanographer who chronicled his findings on film. As was what happened with others who are fond of animals, the ABZU Diver was annoyed that Zissou attempted to kill a rare jaguar shark, but said annoyance subsided after learning that Zissou didn’t follow through on fulfilling that goal. Zissou mistakenly thought that the ABZU Diver was a human who spent a long time wearing diving gear upon meeting her for the first time. The two still maintain a good friendship with each other regardless, with Zissou sometimes recording the ABZU Diver’s adventures underwater and interacting with the various aquatic life that comes with it.
* Zissou’s quest to find the jaguar shark came with a prominent obstacle in the form of pirates who stole some money and a “bond company stooge” that was needed to keep the project going. A rescue mission took place which was successful, but in the Pantheon, there was a possibility that a similar incident would take place, even with Zissou being more prepared for such a thing after what had happened. While most of the pirates in the Pantheon simply seek out treasure and glory, there are a few such as Black Manta who are actively malicious and possibly more dangerous than the pirates that Team Zissou encountered prior. Black Manta cares little about who he targets so long as he can get something out of it, but Zissou isn’t going to allow a repeat of what happened back then regardless of what kind of ruthless pirates get involved.
* Bikini Bottom was a place that Zissou never heard of and figured that it would make for an interesting subject for a documentary of his after being told it was home to a wide variety of sea life. What Zissou didn’t expect when he went to that place to film the documentary was that the sea life there behaved very similarly to that of normal humans, along with an assortment of other quirks that were seemingly impossible in any other typical underwater setting. The denizens of Bikini Bottom were used to having a French-sounding narrator go over their escapades and were surprised to have someone who didn’t have that accent go over Bikini Bottom, especially after Spongebob and his friends saw Zissou wear a red beanie hat with him. That those sea creatures can understand him was another surprise for Zissou and some of his subsequent chronicling of Bikini Bottom involved hidden cameras placed throughout certain areas, though the residents of Bikini Bottom have been used to having their weird adventures chronicled in one way or another.
* In addition to those from Bikini Bottom, there was a wide variety of unusual aquatic life for Zissou to look into. These ranged from largely benign fish (even if some of them aren’t all that interested in coming in close contact with a human) to larger and more dangerous aquatic characters such as [[Pantheon/{{Consumption}} Monstro]] that could potentially jeopardize a production if Team Zissou isn’t extremely careful. Zissou was given advanced warning about those dangerous sea creatures, with Dagomon (a malevolent creature from another dimension) being something he should avoid at all costs. While Zissou does have some curiosity about what the Dark Ocean is, the great risks involved (not to mention that others are much more equipped than Team Zissou to go there and fight it) led many to believe that the risks involved aren't worth it for him.
* Zissou is among those who abandoned their desire for revenge for one reason or another. He ended up learning about others who had a similar instance, even in wildly different fields such as what [[Pantheon/{{Storytelling}} Jacket]] had gone through. Jacket ended up going on a violent, vengeful adventure to figure out a series of mysterious incidents and even after finding the person directly responsible for killing his girlfriend, Jacket opted to spare him instead and go after what he believed to be the real threats behind it all. While Zissou can’t say much about Jacket’s moral ambiguity, he is apprehensive overall about hearing other stories about someone fulfilling revenge, mainly because things could get worse if the journey didn’t involve self-reflection and having some close friends during most of it to keep that person in check.
* One of the members of Team Zissou, Pele dos Santos, is a safety expert who also sings David Bowie songs in Portuguese. Bowie himself has stated his fondness for these particular covers of his songs and Zissou ended up meeting the artist while the oceanographer was going on a tour to promote a project of his in the Pantheon. While talking to Bowie, Zissou stated that he was the one who had a musician on the crew that sang those songs and a brief concert took place where Pele dos Santos performed a selection of Bowie songs in Portuguese. Zissou found Bowie to be an interesting fellow and Bowie is curious to see how Pele dos Santos covers Bowie’s later work.
